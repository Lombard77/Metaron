Hello, everyone. Nico here, and welcome to the introduction video.

00:04
In this video, we're going to be covering Outreach 1

00:07
0 1, which is essentially the purpose and goals behind

00:10
Outreach,

00:11
the Outreach equation, which is a bit of cold email

00:14
math,

00:15
warm versus cold audiences, and what is the difference between

00:18
the 2,

00:19
how outreach plays into your overall acquisition strategy,

00:24
and last but not least, different types of outreach strategies

00:28
that you can implement after you've watched through this module.

00:32
Welcome to the outreach foundations module.

00:35
This module is designed to equip you with everything you

00:38
need to know about effective outreach for your AI automation

00:42
agency.

00:43
As far as skills for AAA owners go, mastering outreach

00:47
is about as critical as they come. Effective outreach is

00:51
essential

00:52
for connecting with potential clients and growing your business.

00:56
In order to succeed as a AAA owner, you must

00:59
see outreach for what it truly is and understand its

01:03
intricacies.

01:04
To develop this correct paradigm,

01:07
you can either brute force your way through and learn

01:10
by rapid and consistent failure, or you can leverage this

01:14
program to bring you up to speed as quickly as

01:17
possible.

01:18
Therefore, I've distilled

01:20
key outreach strategies

01:22
and the collective insights from thousands of triple a owners

01:25
in our community

01:27
into this module.

01:29
This will help you master the art of outreach and

01:32
set your agency on a path to connect with more

01:35
potential clients. This module is designed with a couple of

01:37
key goals in mind to help you learn the skills

01:40
needed to build and maintain a successful outreach strategy

01:44
that works for you. Number 1 of these goals is

01:47
understanding the outreach equation.

01:49
You'll learn quickly how to break down outreach metrics and

01:52
calculate potential return on investment,

01:55
giving you a clear picture of outreach potential impact on

01:59
your AAA.

02:00
Number 2 is mastering outreach platforms.

02:03
We'll explore various channels, helping you understand which platform

02:07
is best suited for reaching your target audience

02:11
within the AI automation space.

02:13
Number 3 is different audience types.

02:16
You'll learn the crucial difference between warm and cold outreach,

02:21
understanding

02:22
when and how to use each approach effectively

02:25
for your triple a.

02:27
Number 4 is integrate outreach in your strategy.

02:31
We'll show you how Outreach fits into your overall acquisition

02:35
strategy,

02:36
both for testing new offers and scaling proven campaigns. Number

02:40
5 and last 1 is analyzing strengths and weaknesses.

02:45
You'll gain a balanced understanding of Outreach

02:48
pros

02:49
and cons like with anything,

02:52
allowing you to leverage its strengths

02:54
while mitigating its weaknesses in your AAA operation.

02:58
Here's a bit of a module overview and here's what

03:01
we're going to cover in each video of this AAA

03:04
foundations module.

03:05
Introduction, which is this video, will lay the groundwork for

03:09
effective outreach,

03:11
introducing key concepts,

03:12
and setting a stage for your deep dive into mastering

03:16
outreach for your AAA.

03:18
Video number 2 is going to be about outreach theory.

03:21
We'll explore the fundamental principles

03:24
of successful outreach,

03:26
breaking down research methods, messaging strategies, and frameworks

03:30
for crafting compelling campaigns.

03:33
Video number 3 is going to be about outreach mindsets.

03:36
We'll examine the psychology

03:38
behind successful outreach, guiding you through key mindset shifts and

03:43
mental frameworks

03:45
that are essential for overcoming obstacles

03:47
and achieving your outreach goals. Video number 4 is about

03:51
platforms.

03:53
We'll do a deep dive into the various platforms and

03:56
tools available

03:57
covering email, LinkedIn, Instagram,

04:00
and lead generation tools to equip you with the right

04:03
resources

04:04
for every situation. Video number 5 is going to be

04:07
about cold email setup. We'll cover the essentials

04:10
of setting up effective cold email campaigns,

04:12
including domain selection,

04:14
email authentication,

04:16
and the crucial warm up process to maximize deliverability

04:20
to get responses.

04:21
Because the truth here is if you're in the spam

04:24
box, no one's ever gonna reply to you. So this

04:26
is a very, very important video.

04:28
Lastly, we've got Calendly setup.

04:31
We'll guide you through how to configure Calendly for optimal

04:35
performance,

04:36
covering event types, workflows, lead qualification,

04:40
and creating effective confirmation pages to boost your show up

04:44
rates.

04:45
It doesn't matter how many beat meetings you book, if

04:47
no 1 shows up for the meetings, you're at the

04:49
same stage as you were before you started. Now let's

04:52
get into outreach. Outreach 1 0 1. The primary purpose

04:56
of outreach is to interrupt your target audience's

05:00
regular pattern and capture their attention.

05:04
By providing value at addressing their specific needs or pain

05:07
points, you can spark interest, build relationships,

05:10
and ultimately

05:12
drive them to take the action

05:14
you want them to take. Outreach is the proactive process

05:17
of initiating contact with a potential customer

05:21
or partner

05:22
to achieve a specific business goal, such as booking a

05:26
meeting, making a sale, or establishing a partnership.

05:30
Your outreach arsenal is just as an entrepreneur

05:33
must choose the right vehicle for their business,

05:36
a AAA owner must select the most effective outreach channels

05:40
to interrupt

05:42
and capture their audience attention.

05:44
Here are the main platforms with various examples of audiences

05:48
that are a fit for the different platforms.

05:51
Emails is a great channel for prospects who primarily communicate

05:55
through emails

05:56
already for their business.

05:58
LinkedIn is a great channel for b to b prospects

06:02
and b to b businesses

06:04
who spend time on LinkedIn

06:06
for networking.

06:08
Cold calling is also another great channel,

06:11
very effective for industries that frequently handle

06:14
appointments

06:15
and calls.

06:17
Social media is a great channel if it's used in

06:20
the correct way for industries with a strong social presence

06:25
or the industry generally has content based acquisition.

06:29
Direct mail is another channel that will make you stand

06:32
out in a crowded market with a unique approach. This

06:35
is not something a lot of people take the time

06:37
to do to send people actual direct mail to their

06:41
office or to their mailbox.

06:43
This is something that's really gonna make you stand out

06:45
and is particularly helpful for industries that are crowded, where

06:49
there might be a lot of LinkedIn DMs going around,

06:50
a lot of emails, whatever your poison is when it

06:53
comes to the channel. This is a great way to

06:55
supplement that. Bit of an insight on this 1 is

06:58
that it's very well leveraged

07:01
if you do this when you have gathered the initial

07:04
interest from before.

07:06
Meaning, they might have positively replied to some outreach, maybe

07:08
you're in the exploration phase, maybe you're in the contract

07:11
stage, whatever that might be, sending them something in the

07:15
mail will really make you stand out. Now we're gonna

07:17
talk a lot more about this later, but just to

07:19
give a bit of an insight. Lastly, we've got event

07:22
based, which is industries who have frequent conferences

07:26
and or networking events. This is a great way to

07:29
get your hands on people that you don't know from

07:31
before.

07:31
To truly appreciate the potential impact of Outreach on your

07:35
AAA,

07:36
let's break down some quick napkin math together. This exercise

07:40
is built to help you understand the power of consistent

07:43
outreach and its potential of driving revenue.

07:47
Let's do some cold email math together. Let's break down

07:49
a hypothetical scenario

07:51
based on very conservative

07:53
estimates.

07:54
Let's pretend we send a thousand emails a day. Out

07:57
of those 1000 emails,

07:58
50 percent of them gets opened. That means 500 people

08:01
open our email. Out of those 500 email, let's pretend

08:05
we have a 2 and a half percent reply rate.

08:08
That means we have 12 and a half people reply

08:11
for every 1000 emails we send them.

08:14
Out of those 12 replies, some are gonna be negative,

08:16
some are gonna be no, I don't want it. So

08:18
let's pretend that 15 percent

08:21
of these overall replies are positive.

08:24
This is extremely conservative. We're gonna be talking a lot

08:27
more about this as we go deeper into the theory

08:29
modules and that kind of stuff with metrics, but just

08:31
know that 15 percent positive replies is really conservative.

08:35
Out of those, we will get 2 booked meetings.

08:38
If we calculate that we have about a 75 percent

08:41
show up rate to these actual meetings, we're gonna have

08:44
1 and a half live demos every single day.

08:47
Now out of those live demos, not everyone is gonna

08:49
close. That's the nature. So let's pretend that we have

08:52
a 20 percent close rate,

08:54
meaning 1000 emails a day with these metrics,

08:58
which again are conservative,

08:59
will lead to 0.3

09:01
closes

09:02
a day.

09:04
You do the math on that. You start sending 10000

09:06
emails. You're gonna start closing 3 deals a day. There's

09:09
a lot of work associated with this. We're gonna be

09:12
covering everything you need to know, but I need you

09:13
to understand the potential impact that this can have on

09:16
your triple a. This is a quick little graphic explaining

09:19
the difference between

09:21
outreach and video content.

09:23
Outreach is something you can control. You can choose how

09:26
many people you email a day. You can choose how

09:27
many DMs you send a day. This is something you

09:30
pick and you control.

09:31
While with content on the other side, it's

09:35
a lot of the things that happen is not necessarily

09:37
in your hands. The algorithm might change. Maybe

09:40
this video doesn't perform as good, which now you suddenly

09:42
don't have leads. And this is to show you that

09:45
even if you do have content and other means of

09:49
acquisition, cold and outreach is a great way of setting

09:52
up something consistent that you can actually control.

09:55
Now when we come to the investment versus return, this

09:58
is playing into the math that we just did and

10:00
the equation.

10:01
Assuming there's 20 business days per month, here's what the

10:04
numbers would look like using the equation above here. We're

10:08
gonna send 20000 emails a month if we send 1000

10:11
a day. Right? Which is gonna lead to 6 deals

10:14
closed

10:15
every single month,

10:16
which could be a revenue of 12000 dollars a month.

10:20
This is calculated at 2000 dollars per deal, so you

10:23
can replace this with whatever and you do the math.

10:26
The cost, like anything, there's obviously costs associated with this.

10:31
Whether that is your time or whether that is money.

10:32
In this case, it's both. The way this is set

10:34
up to give you a bit of context is when

10:37
you're setting up emails, which is this specific example, you're

10:39
gonna have to pay for your domain 1 year upfront.

10:43
Meaning the first month is gonna be more expensive than

10:46
the following 11 months, which is why I'm saying here

10:49
first month tech cost and then ongoing monthly tech costs.

10:52
And this is a very rough ballpark just to keep

10:54
you in the loop. Again, if this doesn't make too

10:56
much sense now, don't stress about this. This is kinda

10:59
just to bring you in the loop and then we're

11:00
gonna go through everything a lot more in detail later.

11:04
When it comes to the return, when we're looking at

11:06
these numbers, this is what we're looking at. The first

11:08
month, we're gonna gain a revenue of 12000

11:11
dollars minus the money we had to spend, which was

11:14
260,

11:15
and we're gonna be left with 11740

11:19
dollars in profits.

11:20
There's obviously things we gotta consider here like margins and

11:23
all that kind of other stuff. But once we're looking

11:25
at it from an outreach perspective, this is what it

11:27
could generate me. And for the following 11 months, like

11:30
we talked about,

11:31
it would be 11880

11:35
dollars.

11:36
And this is considering that every single deal is a

11:39
1 deal and stop. This is not calculating

11:42
reoccurring revenue as a deal. Right? This is they pay

11:45
you 2000 dollars and they don't see you again. So

11:48
if you start calculating in the reoccurring

11:50
revenue part of this, this number definitely goes a lot.

11:53
Right? The lifetime value of a customer.

11:55
Now a bit of a real check with this is

11:59
these results

12:00
represent a well optimized outreach systems and not typical initial

12:05
outcomes.

12:06
Much like mastering the triple a model, achieving this level

12:09
of success

12:10
requires time,

12:11
experience,

12:12
and continuous refinement.

12:14
Not to mention that you're also gonna have to go

12:16
through a bit of failure to get to this part.

12:19
I've been doing this for over 3 years now and

12:21
I can guarantee you that I've been making a lot

12:24
of mistakes to actually get to the stage now where

12:27
I can make it work. Right? I've been making it

12:29
work for a while but it took me years to

12:31
actually get there, make the mistakes, and understand everything going

12:34
on. Since you guys have access to this program, that's

12:37
gonna massively shortcut

12:39
how much

12:40
time you need to actually get to this stage, which

12:42
is a whole goal of this module and the following

12:44
modules around Outreach. Right? So pay attention. Make sure you

12:48
actually learn what we're talking about, not just listen. The

12:51
next section we're gonna be talking about is warm versus

12:55
cold audiences.

12:56
Just as there are multiple channels to choose from,

13:00
there are also different types of audiences to choose from.

13:04
Understanding the distinction between warm

13:07
and cold outreach

13:08
is crucial for developing effective strategies. Right?

13:12
In the world of outreach, understanding your audience is crucial

13:15
and there's 2 main types of outreach. Warm warm outreach

13:19
is contacting potential clients or customers with whom there is

13:23
already some form of prior connection.

13:27
For AAA owners, warm outreach can be particularly powerful in

13:30
the early stages of your business.

13:32
It allows you to leverage your existing network,

13:35
often leading to quicker wins and valuable feedback to refine

13:39
your offerings

13:40
that you can then bring to the call audiences.

13:43
Examples of warm outreach strategies

13:46
can include

13:47
previous coworkers,

13:48
friends, family, or acquaintances,

13:51
past customers,

13:52
clients, or referrals,

13:55
individuals who have engaged with your content or your brand

13:59
online,

14:00
or extended network like friends of friends,

14:03
friends of family, and things like that.

14:06
When it comes to cold outreach,

14:08
cold outreach is the process of contacting potential clients

14:12
or customers with whom you have no prior relationship with.

14:16
For triple a owners, mastering

14:18
cold outreach can open doors to significant growth opportunities.

14:23
It enables you to connect with decision makers

14:26
who might not be in your existing network but could

14:29
greatly benefit from your AI solutions.

14:32
There's always more people out there needing your solution.

14:35
The truth is you're never gonna know them all. Right?

14:38
Examples of cold outreach strategies include prospects from a purchased

14:43
lead list,

14:44
decision makers at companies in your target market,

14:47
individuals who fit your ICP ideal customer profile, but haven't

14:52
interacted with your brand. When it comes to making the

14:54
decision on this, the outreach decision. Right? Do we pick

14:58
warm or do we pick cold? Warm outreach typically yields

15:02
higher responses

15:03
and conversion rates due to the pre established level of

15:07
familiarity

15:08
and trust, which is 2 very important factors when it

15:12
comes to sales. Right?

15:13
These connections

15:14
often lead to more manageable and long term relationship.

15:18
For those just starting their triple a journey, leveraging warm

15:21
outreach will provide significant advantages.

15:24
It's very advisable to begin with warm connections when possible,

15:29
capitalizing

15:29
on existing relationships to build momentum as clearly shown in

15:33
the triple a road map. If you haven't already seen

15:36
this road map, go back and make sure you watch

15:38
the video on success formula

15:40
where Liam explains and talks through the roadmap.

15:44
Remember, the choice between warm and cold isn't always binary.

15:49
As you grow your triple a, you likely employ a

15:51
mix of both strategies,

15:53
adapting your approach based on your audience

15:57
and business goals.

15:59
Outreach in your acquisition strategy.

16:01
Outreach is a key component

16:03
of comprehensive acquisition for any AAA.

16:07
Acquisition is the act of getting a new customer for

16:10
your business, while acquisition strategy

16:13
is the plan for consistently

16:16
attracting and converting new customers to grow your business. When

16:19
visualizing your overall approach to building your AAA, Outreach fits

16:23
alongside

16:23
other elements like content creation, paid advertising, and networking.

16:28
If you haven't already, be sure to review the AAA

16:30
roadmap, which provides a visual representation

16:33
of this concept.

16:34
Here is what it looks like. Again, if you haven't

16:37
already watched

16:38
the success formula video from Liam where he thoroughly goes

16:42
through this document,

16:44
make sure to watch that. Well, here you can see

16:46
Outreach starts over here while simultaneously

16:50
starting to make the content to generate inbound leads.

16:53
That's all I'm gonna show, so make sure to go

16:56
watch that video if you haven't already.

16:58
In the world of triple a, outreach serves 2 primary

17:02
functions, testing

17:04
and scaling.

17:05
Understanding how to leverage these aspects can significantly impact your

17:08
business growth. Testing. Before investing heavily into a new offer,

17:13
niche, or channel,

17:14
Outreach allows you to validate your educated

17:17
assumptions

17:19
and gather real world feedback.

17:22
By conducting targeted outreach campaigns, you can test your messaging,

17:26
pricing, and positioning.

17:29
This process enables you to refine your approach based on

17:32
actual responses from your target audience.

17:35
Testing is the process of validating your business assumptions,

17:39
offers, and messaging through targeted outreach campaigns before

17:43
committing significant resources to it. For AAA owners, this testing

17:48
phase is invaluable.

17:50
It allows you to fine tune your AI solutions and

17:53
ensure they truly resonate with your potential clients before committing

17:57
significant resources to a particular

18:00
direction.

18:01
This is a very important step

18:03
that a lot of people overlook.

18:05
So we've been talking a lot about niches. We've been

18:07
talking a lot about offering. And the name of the

18:09
game when it comes to this is that it's all

18:11
about testing.

18:12
You don't have to brand your whole brand and image

18:15
and company into 1 industry, 1 offer, 1 service. The

18:19
idea of this is that we get to test different

18:21
things to see what sticks,

18:24
and then we can draw conclusions and brand ourselves or

18:27
commit ourselves accordingly. Right?

18:29
When it comes to scaling,

18:31
once you have validated your approach and found a winning

18:34
formula or strategy,

18:36
Outreach becomes a

18:38
very powerful tool for scaling your business because you can

18:42
reliably increase your results

18:44
by expanding your outreach efforts, giving you a level of

18:47
control that these other channels might not offer.

18:51
With other channels, I'm referring to things like content creation.

18:54
Right?

18:55
And scaling is the strategic

18:58
expansion of successful outreach efforts

19:00
to reliably increase results

19:03
and grow your AAA business. Unlike platforms where your account

19:06
can be suspended

19:08
or algorithms could change, like social media or advertising platforms,

19:12
your ability to conduct outreach is a skill that cannot

19:16
be taken away from you. This is a very important

19:20
thing.

19:20
Outreach and the skills you learn around it can never

19:23
be taken away from you. It's a extremely valuable skill.

19:26
We're gonna talk a lot more about this later once

19:28
we get into the theory module, but just know that.

19:32
This makes it a particularly valuable asset for triple a

19:35
owners looking to build a stable long term growth strategy.

19:40
Strengths and weaknesses

19:42
of outreach.

19:43
Just like any business strategy, outreach has its own set

19:47
of strategies

19:48
and weaknesses.

19:50
Understanding these can help you leverage outreach effectively

19:53
in your AAA journey.

19:55
When it comes to strengths,

19:57
outreach has something very particular like scalability.

20:01
It's very easy to expand

20:03
by adding more accounts

20:05
or implementing automations.

20:07
It's very cost effective once you get it to work,

20:11
lower expenses compared to traditional

20:13
advertising,

20:15
time efficient,

20:16
reach a lot of prospects

20:19
quickly with templated approaches and softwares that help you do

20:22
things.

20:23
Trackable,

20:24
you get very clear metrics for measuring and improving your

20:28
campaign's performance.

20:30
Systematized,

20:31
it scales well with automations and as you go on

20:34
and refine the processes.

20:36
Targeted

20:37
allows for highly personalized communication and you can target whoever

20:41
you want. You can tell YouTube to show your video

20:44
to a specific person,

20:46
but if you outreach to them, you can send them

20:49
a message, meaning they're gonna be the 1 seeing it.

20:52
Relationship building enables trust development with potential goods customers.

20:57
Insightful.

20:58
It provides feedback

21:00
to refine our offer and positioning in every other part

21:03
of our business. As I said, like with everything, there's

21:06
gonna be weaknesses here too. Regulated, it's subject to legal

21:10
restrictions and compliance issues depending on location.

21:13
Delayed feedback, results may take time to materialize.

21:18
Data dependence

21:20
relies on quality

21:21
and accuracy of lead information.

21:24
Meaning, if you mess up the lead gathering,

21:27
you might think your offer didn't work, but because your

21:30
leads were bad, that's why no 1 answered your email.

21:32
This is something we're gonna dive a lot deeper into

21:35
when it comes to troubleshooting, how to fix, what to

21:37
fix, looking at metrics, all that good stuff. But I

21:40
just want you to know that this is 1 of

21:41
the weaknesses.

21:43
Potentially intrusive

21:45
can be seen as unwelcome

21:47
by some recipients.

21:48
Variable response rates

21:51
may have lower engagement

21:53
than the other channels like inbound YouTube, LinkedIn, that kind

21:56
of stuff.

21:57
Time intensity.

21:59
It requires effort

22:00
for research and personalization and not to mention getting started

22:04
and learning the skills for making this work.

22:07
Resistance risk may face negative reactions,

22:11
if not value focus, which is something we're gonna be

22:14
talking a whole lot about later.

22:17
Skill dependent, which is

22:19
effectiveness,

22:21
relies on outreach expertise and writing skills.

22:24
This is

22:25
a lot of the time not something you can just

22:27
put together and it works. You have to actually understand

22:30
everything to make it work, which is what this whole

22:33
module is about, helping you understand it so you can

22:35
make something good. Types of outreach strategies. Within the channels

22:39
we discussed earlier, there are various strategies you can employ

22:43
depending on your audience and goals.

22:45
Let's explore some effective approaches

22:48
for your triple a outreach.

22:50
Value first approach,

22:52
which is where you offer a small piece of actionable

22:55
advice or lead magnet

22:58
demonstrating your expertise

23:00
and the potential value of working with your company.

23:04
Number 2 is straight shooter.

23:07
Explain your service clearly and concisely,

23:10
then ask directly

23:12
for a meeting.

23:13
This no nonsense approach can be refreshing for busy decision

23:17
makers who appreciate getting to the point quickly,

23:20
which is particularly applicable for an industry that is very

23:24
competitive where they might get a lot of outreach messages.

23:28
Number 3 is personalized video content.

23:31
Use tools like Loom to create custom messages

23:35
or quick demos of potential AI solutions

23:38
tailored to specific prospects.

23:40
This personal touch can help you stand out and demonstrate

23:44
your understanding

23:45
of their unique needs.

23:47
It also shows that you've taken the time unlike everyone

23:50
else to actually look into them and see what they

23:52
would need, hence, you're coming up with this idea for

23:55
them.

23:57
Problem solution pitch which is number 4.

24:00
Identify a specific problem within the prospect's industry

24:04
or business and then briefly outline

24:07
how your AI can address the issue.

24:10
Remember, these strategies aren't mutually exclusive.

24:13
You can combine them for maximum impact. There is no

24:17
limits here. The key to stand out is consider what

24:20
would resonate most with your specific audience.

24:25
This is something we're gonna talk a lot more about

24:27
where audience

24:28
and market research is the fundamental

24:31
or it's the fundament of building everything in terms of

24:34
your acquisition strategy and terms of your outreach strategy.

24:37
And something I've seen work really well over the last

24:39
couple of years that always tends to work well is

24:42
pairing 3 of these together.

24:44
It is value first approach, personalized video content, and problem

24:48
solution pitch.

24:50
1 of the things you can do is if you

24:52
find out a company is using a specific platform,

24:55
that might expose them to a specific problem that you

24:58
can fix.

24:59
The approach here is that you're giving them value or

25:03
a lead magnet that could fix the problem you've identified

25:06
within this company,

25:07
and you give it to them in a personalized video.

25:10
So you kinda marry 3 of these together, which is

25:13
always something that's worked well. The problem with this is

25:15
it takes a lot of manual effort. You have to

25:17
research them, find the problems,

25:19
make the lead magnet if you don't already have it,

25:21
and then record the video.

25:23
And in betweener when it comes to this that a

25:25
lot of people are using nowadays to be able to

25:27
scale their outreach and do automatically

25:29
without putting all this manual effort while still being able

25:32
to have some sort of personal

25:34
relevant

25:35
element is we'll reach out to people and we'll say,

25:39
because you were using HubSpot, I see you have this

25:41
specific problem.

25:42
I recorded you a video on how I can fix

25:45
the problem, which is the value first approach. Right? We're

25:47
saying that I see you have this problem. I'd love

25:49
to fix it for you. I recorded you a video

25:51
on how you can fix it.

25:53
And we're saying we recorded you the video. Would you

25:56
want me to send it? And we don't actually prerecord

25:58
anything, but when they reply yes, we will sit down

26:01
and record the video. That way we don't waste any

26:03
time recording any videos for people who wouldn't see the

26:06
message or be interested. Right?

26:08
This is something we're gonna talk a lot more about.

26:10
Just wanted to kinda put that in here because it

26:11
suits with the outreach strategies and how they marry together.

26:15
Now looking ahead, before we move on to the next

26:18
video, let's recap the key concepts we've covered in this

26:21
introduction

26:22
to outreach

26:24
and outline what's coming up next in your journey to

26:27
master outreach for your triple a. The key takeaways are

26:31
outreach is a critical skill for triple a owners, enabling

26:34
you to connect with potential clients and grow your business.

26:39
The outreach equation demonstrates the potential impact of ROI and

26:43
consistent outreach efforts and shows that we would end up

26:46
with 11880

26:48
dollars if we do it right for 11 months straight.

26:51
Without any reoccurring revenue or anything, you can go back

26:54
out. You can change out the numbers to make sense

26:56
for you later and you can do the math yourself.

26:59
Understanding the difference between warm and cold outreach helps you

27:03
tailor your approach to different audience types, and

27:06
number 4 is outreach serves dual functions in your outreach

27:10
strategy. It's for testing new offers

27:13
and

27:14
scaling what works.

27:17
Last key takeaway here is effective outreach strategies have a

27:20
balance between various factors including personalization,

27:24
value first approaches, and clear communication.

27:27
This is something we're gonna be talking massively more about

27:30
but it's good to have the foundational understanding of this.

27:33
In the next video, we'll deep dive into outreach theory,

27:36
exploring the fundamental principles that underpin

27:40
successful outreach campaigns.

27:42
We'll cover research methods,

27:44
which is how you gather crucial information about your audience

27:48
and industry,

27:49
which as I said earlier, this is gonna build the

27:52
whole foundation

27:53
to your outreach strategy.

27:55
It is like pouring the concrete is doing the outreach.

27:58
It is very very important.

28:00
Secondly, we're gonna dive into messaging strategies.

28:03
Techniques for crafting compelling messages that resonate with your prospects,

28:08
different outreach

28:10
frameworks, which is proven structures for building effective outreach campaigns,

28:15
personalization

28:16
techniques

28:17
which is methods to tailor your outreach for potential impact.

28:21
This is 1 of the I wanna say 1 of

28:24
the more overlooked things in 20 24.

28:26
Because AI is getting so fresh, there's a lot of

28:28
tools and techniques out there that you can use to

28:31
not really spend a lot of time and do automatically.

28:34
Therefore,

28:34
if you don't personalize,

28:36
you have no chance of standing out. Nowadays, personalization

28:40
is a absolute must in our reach. It plays into

28:43
everything we do. With emails, it plays into deliverability and

28:47
making sure our emails are unique and not landing in

28:49
spam.

28:50
It also plays into how many replies we're getting, positive

28:53
replies. It also plays into if people put us in

28:56
spam or not. It plays into if people close over

28:58
time because if people just are interested in our firm

29:01
but so we did no personalization, they're gonna be less

29:03
willing to close over time. They might be more warm

29:05
if we took the time to research them or at

29:07
least it seems that way. So personalization techniques is very

29:10
very important and we're gonna cover a lot on that

29:13
too.

29:13
Metrics and analysis.

29:15
The last part we're gonna cover in the next video

29:17
here is how to measure and optimize your outreach performance.

29:22
This deep dive into outreach theory will provide you with

29:25
the knowledge

29:26
and tools

29:27
to create outreach campaigns that capture attention,

29:30
provide value, and actually drive results for your triple a.

29:35
Now let's get ready to take your outreach skills to

29:37
the next level.
