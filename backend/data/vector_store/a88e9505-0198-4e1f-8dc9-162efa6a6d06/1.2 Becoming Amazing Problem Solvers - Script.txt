Welcome to the second module in the sales part of

00:02
this course. Today, we're going to talk about becoming amazing

00:05
problem solvers.

00:06
So look, sales is essentially a problem solving exercise and

00:09
you need to think about it like that. Remember, all

00:12
sales is, is helping our prospects to make the best

00:14
and most informed decision possible.

00:17
Your sales leads, they're there for a reason. They've shown

00:19
an interest already and they want your help. They're willing

00:22
to hear more. This will help you a lot with

00:24
your authority when you get on these calls.

00:27
They have inherent problems with inherent pain points, with inherent

00:30
end goal, with inherent motivations, with the inherent desire for

00:33
solutions

00:35
and that's all you're doing on these calls. You're bridging

00:38
the gap between their problems and the solution you're offering

00:41
And we do this firstly by finding out as much

00:44
information

00:45
about the prospect as we can.

00:47
We do this because we need to understand their problem.

00:50
How can we expect to pitch our solution

00:53
if we can't understand their problem?

00:55
We can't expect to hop on our calls, ramble on

00:58
about how amazing our product is, how it's going to

01:01
revolutionize their business, how it's gonna rapidly increase their lead

01:04
flow or save them heaps of time on administrative tasks

01:07
or whatever it may be. That's just ludicrous quite frankly.

01:11
And let me explain how it is extremely ludicrous.

01:15
Picture this, you're at the gym, you're lifting like an

01:17
absolute beast and all of a sudden the room starts

01:20
to get really really dark and you start to feel

01:22
a little bit light headed. Headed. The last thought that

01:24
goes through your head is, oh, shit. Am I about

01:26
to and you faint.

01:28
You wake up. You're still all out of it, but

01:31
you think, oh, shit. That wasn't great. You know, I've

01:34
just fainted. That's a problem.

01:36
But I don't know. Maybe you shrug it off and

01:38
you think, you know, mama ain't raising no bitch and

01:40
you just continue on and kick on with, with your

01:42
day within your week.

01:44
But then you get home and you start walking up

01:46
the stairs and once again, everything gets a bit dark

01:49
and you feel a bit light headed and you think

01:51
oh shit.

01:52
You're out like a lion.

01:54
This goes on for an entire week or so and

01:57
you think, you know what? Enough's enough. I need to

01:59
book a doctor's appointment. I can't keep fainting everywhere I

02:02
go. Fair enough. So you book a new appointment, you

02:05
get to the doctor's office and the doctor sits you

02:07
down and says, hey. Look. It says on your on

02:09
your sheet here that you've been fainting a lot and

02:11
getting really light headed. Is that correct? And you say,

02:14
yeah, doc. It's really weird. The doctor cuts you off

02:16
and says, okay. Awesome. You need this emergency surgery straight

02:19
away right now. It's amazing. You're gonna feel super like

02:22
a million bucks. You're gonna be the healthiest you've ever

02:25
been in 2 weeks. Let's get you in the operating

02:26
room right now.

02:28
You're going to sit there and go, what what the

02:30
hell? You know, I've been fainting. I don't have headaches.

02:34
I've been drinking lots of water though, you know, or

02:36
maybe I'm low on iron. Doc, why aren't you asking

02:38
me these questions? Why aren't you asking for context?

02:41
Obviously, you're not going to go on the operating table.

02:43
Maybe some of you will but that's probably a pretty

02:44
stupid idea.

02:46
The idea is the doctor needs to be understanding your

02:49
problems as the patient in order to solve your issues.

02:52
Otherwise, you as the patient is not going to have

02:54
full confidence in the doctor for actually solving your problems.

02:57
The same goes for you and your business and your

02:59
clients. You're the doctor in this instance. You can't expect

03:03
to purchase a solution

03:04
to your patients or your clients without fully understanding their

03:08
problem.

03:09
Again, remember,

03:10
sales is a problem solving exercise.

03:13
You need to understand their problem in order to bridge

03:15
the gap between

03:17
their problem and ideally where they want to be and

03:20
making that gap, making that bridge your solution.

03:22
It's all about making them understand the vehicle in which

03:26
it's gonna take them from point a where they are

03:28
at the moment to point b where they wanna be.

03:30
You can't expect to pretend that you know the vehicle

03:33
without understanding their problem fully first.
