K. Now getting into the future of AI services. We

00:03
couldn't finish this video up on the economics of AI

00:05
automation without addressing the elephant in the room. Won't self

00:08
serve AI tools eventually make AI automation agencies obsolete? This

00:11
fear comes up constantly in our industry as AI platforms

00:14
become more and more user friendly and SaaS solutions emerge.

00:17
Won't businesses just implement everything themselves? And of course, this

00:20
concern isn't new. So let's dismantle it by looking at

00:22
a very powerful historical parallel. Of course, we look back

00:25
to the web which is not too long ago now

00:28
and we have in 19 95 websites,

00:31
having only really technical experts being able to build them.

00:34
10 years later by 2005,

00:36
you start to get website builders emerge like WordPress and

00:39
things like this. And they ultimately predicted to kill web

00:41
development agencies, Kill

00:43
these experts that are building websites. It's like, oh, in

00:45
the future, I'll be able to do it all myself

00:46
and I won't need this. I'll just be able to

00:49
go on to this and type in a few words

00:50
and move it around. I won't need to pay someone

00:53
50, a hundred thousand, 200000 dollars for a website. Well,

00:57
by 20 23, web development is a 250000000000

01:01
dollar industry and growing 23 percent annually. If anything, it

01:05
accelerated

01:06
the growth of the web development, custom web development industry.

01:08
So what actually happened here? Website builders like WordPress and

01:12
then Wix and Squarespace and things like these, they didn't

01:14
kill the web agencies.

01:16
They essentially expanded the market dramatically. They helped millions of

01:19
businesses understand the value of having a web presence. They

01:22
essentially lowered the bar of what financial investment and time

01:25
investment businesses need to give in order to just get

01:27
on the web and see what the benefits were. You

01:30
know, as soon as they start getting that, oh, you've

01:31
just received a new, inquiry or bang, we've just received

01:34
a new lead or some cha ching, someone's just purchased

01:36
on our website and you're like, holy moly. I just

01:38
put this bloody

01:42
amount of traffic and these number of calls and these

01:44
people reaching out to work with me without having to

01:46
go to an agency and engage in this long process.

01:48
So the self serve platforms and these tech revolutions drastically

01:51
expand the bottom end of the market and make the

01:53
benefits of the technology much more accessible to the bottom

01:56
half of people who maybe just starting a business or

01:59
a bit of a lag in technology wise and they

02:01
don't know how to work with a dev agency. They

02:03
don't know what they want. They're a bit scared by

02:04
it. And as all of these businesses grew, the ones

02:06
who just started to build on these platforms,

02:08
many of them eventually graduated to working with professional agencies

02:11
who could deliver more sophisticated

02:13
and customized designs. It's like a drug dealer giving them

02:16
a a little hit here and getting them hooked and

02:18
go, oh, wow. I can really see the value in

02:20
having this website now. And then sure enough down the

02:22
line, they start trying to sell them bigger and bigger

02:24
bags or whatever drug dealer reference you wanna make here.

02:26
But eventually, people who started off on website builders thinking,

02:29
oh, I can just do it myself,

02:31
their business takes off. They eventually go, well, if this

02:33
is doing such a big part of my business or

02:35
it's such a big part of our acquisition and how

02:38
we present ourselves to the world, then maybe it is

02:40
worthwhile us investing 20, 30, 40, a hundred thousand, 200000

02:44
dollars in really nailing our web presence. So that's how

02:47
we see graphs like this where we have the entire

02:50
web development industry in 19 95 and the web development

02:53
agencies and people who are doing web development as a

02:56
service are in here. Then by 2005,

02:58
we have the entire

03:00
industry. So the website development industry itself has grown many

03:03
times.

03:04
And actually, these 2 should probably be swapped around in

03:06
size where you have website building platforms sort of a

03:09
bit smaller and on the rise. And you have web

03:11
development agencies still taking up a significant chunk, but overall,

03:15
the size of the market has grown a ton. And

03:17
then by now, you see that we have like this

03:19
enormous market. Like it says here, 250000000000

03:22
dollars and growing 23 percent annually. The size of the

03:25
market is just so much bigger and these both of

03:27
them have grown a huge amount inside that as well.

03:30
So it's not like 1 cannibalizes the other and the

03:33
size of the industry remains static. The size of the

03:35
industry is still getting bigger and bigger by the day,

03:38
but the distribution of it is changing around. Both of

03:40
them are growing. So you have these thriving website building

03:43
platforms and then that money is in funneled up to

03:45
the web development platforms as well. And the exact same

03:47
thing is going to happen of course with AI agencies

03:49
and AI automation agency services where right now we are

03:52
here. And we're starting to have these self serve platforms

03:54
where businesses can kinda do it themselves if they know

03:56
what they're doing. But it's still quite difficult and we'll

03:59
see this maybe with like AI receptionist as an example

04:02
where they can either come to an agency now and

04:03
pay quite a lot of money to get 1 built

04:05
or someone might make a sass around say, wrap it

04:08
around VAPI or or an AI voice or 11 Labs

04:10
and make a wrap around that. They make a sass

04:12
that's like AI receptionist

04:14
DIY and they try it and they go, wow. This

04:16
is really cool. And they realize how how powerful it

04:18
is and then they go, okay. Well, if it's so

04:20
powerful and such a big part of our business, why

04:22
don't we see if there's someone who's actually a specialist

04:24
in this who can build us a custom 1 that

04:25
does all the things that we needed to do because

04:27
this platform doesn't quite do that. And that's when the

04:30
demand then funnels back to us as the agencies. So

04:32
it's only gonna continue to grow and scale as the

04:34
industry grows. We are still just scratching the surface of

04:38
the extraction of value from the AI services industry of

04:41
how much money needs to be spent across all businesses

04:43
worldwide to make the transition. It's fucking ludicrous.

04:46
The same pattern is gonna merge with AI automations. Like

04:48
I said, we'll get self serve tools and SaaS solutions

04:51
that will help businesses to understand

04:53
AI's potential. They actually try it themselves. They get a

04:55
little hit and try it like, holy moly. This is

04:57
awesome. And it's actually good because these platforms are gonna

04:59
have to run ads and create awareness and acquire these

05:01
customers and get them to use their software. And then

05:03
eventually, they'll just go, oh, that was fun. Okay. And

05:05
I'm gonna go to someone who really knows what they're

05:06
doing. I need more features. So they're gonna go and

05:09
market stuff for us and we can just piggyback and

05:11
sit there and kinda camp the spawners as these people

05:13
come out eager for more custom implementation of that particularly

05:16
valuable AI system. So businesses will do their early experiments

05:19
with their basic tools just to prove the ROI and

05:21
make sure they're comfortable with it. Then growing businesses will

05:23
actually seek expertise

05:25
through agencies like ourselves in order to maximize those returns.

05:27
So let me go to a specialized AI voice agency

05:30
who can really do this and they know what they're

05:32
doing. They've got a lot of experience with other clients

05:34
and they can knock knock this thing out of the

05:36
park for us and get us even better results than

05:37
our competitors. So here you can see we've got a

05:39
market evolution funnel. You gonna have the self serve solution

05:42
at the top where they're marketing like crazy. They're getting

05:44
all these people into their platforms. Like, oh, cool. These

05:47
chat bots are pretty nice with these voice agents or

05:49
this automation was really handy.

05:50
And then when they see how much value it's gonna

05:53
provide, they ultimately go, well, maybe it's worthwhile sort of

05:55
doing a they might run into some issues with it.

05:57
I need it to do this or this. Then that

05:59
comes the agency and that's where we're perfectly positioned to

06:01
to monetize that demand. So if we think about Mike's

06:03
plumbing business from a previous example, he had 3 options.

06:06
First 1 would be to build an internal AI team

06:08
himself which might be on a 300 grand annually. If

06:12
he's a team of maybe 2 or 3 people, that's

06:14
easily 300 grand. If you're getting good devs, it's gonna

06:16
be pretty slow to develop that expertise. He has to

06:18
go and hire all these people. He's gonna have some

06:20
sort of management overhead on actually managing that team and

06:22
they're gonna have limited cross industry insights. So he's only

06:25
really gonna grab some devs, put them in his business

06:26
and say, let's figure this out. Whereas, if you're working

06:28
with an agency, they're gonna be able to see across

06:30
industries the patterns and how things are being implemented for

06:33
maximum effect.

06:35
The other option would be to use self serve tools

06:37
if they existed for him at that time. Let's say

06:40
maybe you were implementing them a little bit more down

06:42
the line when John was and there are self serve

06:44
tools. They might be cheaper upfront but they're gonna have

06:46
a limited capabilities. It's gonna be fairly time consuming for

06:49
them to learn how to set it up and use

06:50
it themselves. There's gonna be little to no strategic guidance

06:53
from the platform, maybe a bit of documentation. So they're

06:55
kinda using trial and error to get themselves to where

06:57
they want to go. So it might take them a

06:59
lot longer than if they work with an agency which

07:01
is the final option here. Where you pay for immediate

07:04
expertise. These people know what they're doing. They've given me

07:06
a clear quote. And they've got proven implementation methods. They've

07:09
done it for other people. They can do rapid deployments.

07:11
They basically just bolt on something that they've done from

07:13
someone else, and they've got a clear ROI timeline. Look,

07:15
it's gonna take 4 weeks for this and then another

07:17
4 weeks of testing. And then by the end of

07:20
it, we're going to be, basically ready to step out

07:22
and train your team on it. So for a business

07:24
owner focus on growth, their choice is pretty clear when

07:27
you look at these options. Right? You're gonna pay for

07:29
the expertise that delivers results quickly. Right? The real cost

07:32
isn't in the implementation. It's the opportunity cost delayed or

07:35
suboptimal results.

07:37
In both of these, it's going to take a long

07:39
time, a drawn out process of a lot of effort.

07:42
Whereas here, they might pay a bit more in the

07:44
in the near term, but they get expertise,

07:46
they get rapid results, and they're not gonna have to

07:49
be spending a huge amount annually. And they can really

07:51
get it spun up as fast as possible with the

07:53
highest chance of success for them to get a return

07:55
on their investment.

07:57
So just as the website builder market grew alongside professional

08:00
web development, we'll see similar expansion in AI automation. We

08:03
have got self serve tools which will create awareness, basic

08:06
implementations will provide value to those businesses, and then complex

08:09
needs will drive agency growth and demand for agency services.

08:12
The key is understanding that different businesses need different levels

08:15
of service.

08:16
Some will succeed with self-service tools, others will need full

08:19
agency support. The market is big enough for both and

08:21
growing larger every day. This This is why successful triple

08:24
a's focus on businesses who value speed to market, they

08:27
understand the opportunity cost, they need reliable implementation, and they

08:30
want proven expertise and they're willing to pay for it.

08:33
For these clients, the question isn't can we do this

08:35
ourselves, but how quickly can we get results? We just

08:38
need to position ourselves as experts in the market so

08:40
that when those businesses are ready to make the dive

08:42
with cash in hand, we will be right there to

08:44
help them. And that comes a lot through content and

08:46
marketing yourself effectively which we'll cover extensively in this course

08:49
in inbound systems. So the key takeaways of this section

08:51
is that the future of AI services presents a compelling

08:54
opportunity for AI automation agencies despite concerns about self serve

08:57
tools and emerging SaaS solutions. Understanding the market dynamics helps

09:00
to build confidence in the long term viability of the

09:02
triple a model. We have the historical precedent of the

09:04
web development industry's evolution and shows how new technologies expand

09:08
rather than contract from professional services.

09:11
They create market awareness. They catalyze basic implementations that prove

09:14
business value to skeptics or people who are on the

09:17
fence. The growing complexity of the systems that they try

09:19
to build on these platforms drives demand for increased expertise

09:22
and custom development and the market size increases both for

09:24
DIY and professional services as a result of that. The

09:27
implementation reality is that businesses face 3 distinct paths to

09:30
AI adoption. The latter makes most sense in most cases

09:33
at start of the AI transition or exploration. They can

09:35
either go and make their own internal team which is

09:37
gonna have a high cost, slow development and limited cross

09:40
industry insights. They can go to self serve tools where

09:42
the capabilities will be limited, time consuming to learn and

09:45
they must go through a trial and error process in

09:47
order to see results. And finally, the agency partnership route

09:49
which is immediate expertise, proven methods, rapid deployment, and clear

09:53
ROI.

09:54
And for us as agency owners, success means focusing on

09:57
businesses that value speed to market and understand the opportunity

09:59
cost of delay. Those who want proven expertise rather than

10:02
trying to figure out everything for themselves. Communicating the reality

10:04
of the AI curious businesses will allow you to close

10:06
more deals, which is why we're covering all of this

10:08
right now. Is that like if you are on the

10:10
call then you need to make this case and you

10:11
need to present, look, this is the downside. This is

10:13
the risk if you don't take action on what we're

10:15
offering you here. Sometimes you do need to twist the

10:17
knife a little bit to push people over the edge

10:18
and get them to make the dive into doing this

10:20
for their business. And finally, we have ongoing value delivery

10:23
where triple a's create lasting value by delivering proven solutions

10:25
quickly and reliably, combining technical implementation with strategic guidance to

10:29
accelerate the client's AI transformation journey. So that is really

10:31
your differentiating factor. You have the strategic guidance. You can

10:35
be their partner. You can be a real person they

10:37
can talk to. Sure they can go into all of

10:38
these platforms here and there. And at the end of

10:40
the day, knowing what the latest in the tech is,

10:42
where they should be implementing it, what tools to use

10:45
even. Like you could recommend them self serve stuff to

10:47
use even and say, hey, just try this out. Here's

10:49
our DIY

10:51
guide on how to get this up and running. Do

10:52
it for yourself. See how you like it. And if

10:54
you're ready, you can come to us for the second

10:56
stage and we can do a more custom feature for

10:58
you. But for now, I reckon we work on this

11:00
project here first because we can't. It's like you're really

11:03
at a stage where you need custom development for this

11:05
first. So you can use it as part of your

11:06
strategy. Just help them to get the result that they

11:09
want. So understanding these principles helps to position your agency

11:11
as a clear choice for businesses serious about capturing the

11:13
advantages of early AI adoption while minimizing risk and implementation

11:16
challenges.
