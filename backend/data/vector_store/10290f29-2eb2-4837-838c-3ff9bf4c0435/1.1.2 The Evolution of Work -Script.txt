Alright. So next we have the evolution of work. So

00:04
to truly understand how AI is transforming businesses, we need

00:07
to examine the 3 distinct stages of work evolution, manual,

00:10
assisted, and automated systems. Each represents a different approach to

00:13
getting work done with its own advantages and limitations. More

00:17
importantly, understanding these stages helps us to identify where businesses

00:20
are today and guide them towards more efficient operations. Starting

00:23
off with manual systems, which are the traditional approach. You

00:25
can think of these manual systems like some kind of

00:28
craft person's workshop. Each product is being shaped by human

00:31
hands following a documented process and procedures and checklists. You

00:34
may have heard of SOPs or SOPs before. These are

00:37
standard operating procedures and are how most businesses document the

00:40
processes so that people can be quickly trained to execute

00:43
task correctly and consistently. So for example, here in the

00:46
accelerator, we have a module filming SOP. This is for

00:48
people who are doing guest modules like Nikolai or something.

00:52
I needed to make a basic checklist to make sure

00:54
that they are doing the right things before they start

00:57
filming. So, that I can sort of take my approach

00:59
and take how we do things and put it into

01:01
a document and a checklist for them to follow. This

01:03
is 1 of the most basic forms of of systems.

01:05
This is essentially a system for them to do and

01:07
then it's like when you're done upload it to this

01:09
folder.

01:10
So, while there's beauty in this traditional approach, it comes

01:13
with some pretty inherent limitations that become increasingly apparent as

01:16
businesses try to scale. So, you can consider again a

01:19
typical customer service operation. You've got team members that manually

01:22
respond to each inquiry. They follow a standard response template

01:26
and guidelines provided by the manager, and quality depends entirely

01:29
on the individual's attention and their skill. And capacity is

01:32
directly limited by team size and working hours. So here

01:34
you can see in say a YouTube video creation and

01:37
publishing process, we have the ideation process, we have the

01:39
filming and the writing, we have editing and the posting

01:42
to YouTube. Each of these would have their own system

01:44
or SOP, standard operating procedures. So how do we do

01:46
ideation? Okay. This, this, this, this, this. For writing, okay.

01:49
Well, when it comes to writing, you would do this,

01:51
this, this, this. And for filming, here's a checklist etcetera.

01:54
Each of these different parts of just 1 process within

01:56
the business can be fully broken down and executed on

01:59
by humans just by reading a checklist or a set

02:01
of instructions. So that's the most basic form of system.

02:04
That's a manual system. They don't necessarily have to read

02:06
it every time once they

02:07
know how to do it, but they are still following

02:09
a sequence of steps to get some kind of outcome.

02:11
So the economics of manual systems like these create fundamental

02:14
constraints. Right? You've got linear cost scaling that we've been

02:16
over before. If you wanna handle twice as many customers,

02:19
you'll need twice as many staff. And this direct relationship

02:21
between volume and cost creates a natural ceiling on growth.

02:24
You've got, again, the issue of quality variability. Even your

02:26
best employees have good and bad days. This natural variation

02:29
means that customer experience can fluctuate despite your best efforts

02:32
at standardization across the team. And of course, you have

02:34
time bound operations where work can only happen during business

02:37
hours or when staff are available and awake. This creates

02:39
natural gaps in service and limits global reach. So these

02:42
are the limitations of these manual systems. And in near

02:44
term for the small business, they are good because you

02:46
can just quickly put together a checklist and communicate this

02:48
is how you do it. Right? Here's the system, follow

02:50
it. But as things start to scale which really the

02:53
way to make money with any business, right? Is to

02:56
scale things up. You're gonna run into these issues time

02:58
and time again with these manual systems which brings us

03:00
to assisted systems which are like the current sweet spot

03:04
for systems within businesses. And this is where you have

03:07
rate approach where AI tools are augmenting human capabilities and

03:10
handling routine aspects of tasks while humans maintain the strategic

03:14
control and oversight of it. So how do these assisted

03:16
systems work? Unlike manual systems where humans are doing everything,

03:19
assisted systems create a partnership between AI and human workers.

03:23
The AI handles the time consuming and repetitive aspects of

03:26
work while humans focus on judgment, creativity,

03:28
and relationship management. You have the UiPath CEO talking about

03:32
the relationship between AI systems and humans in his interview

03:34
with Harry Stebbings from 20 VC. I highly recommend you

03:38
check this out. And also just 20 VC as a,

03:41
a place for listening to stuff in the AI space,

03:43
investment, sort of tech. Really, really good podcast. Great, great

03:46
questions that he asked as well. This and the All

03:48
In podcast,

03:50
are my 2 top recommendations for you if you wanna

03:52
be absorbing and listening to very successful people having intelligent

03:55
conversations about technology and AI. So in this video,

03:58
UiPath

03:59
for some context,

04:02
they are an, sort of, OG automation platform, but they

04:04
go for enterprise. If you've heard of RPA or robotic

04:07
process automation.

04:08
This is essentially what their business is based around. You

04:11
have these massive

04:13
massive workflows kind of like make dot com but even

04:16
Gruntia and they can sort of automate stuff within a

04:19
computer. So it's almost like browser automation, computer automation

04:22
where you can say okay click this and then click

04:25
this and then save this. So you can build these

04:27
huge workflows

04:28
and then now obviously going pretty heavy into AI. In

04:31
this interview, Daniel Dines the the CEO and and founder

04:33
made some pretty good points about how he sees AI

04:36
agents and these assisted systems

04:38
becoming, the new way of doing work. So agents will

04:40
make recommendations. Agents are not going to take actions directly.

04:43
There will be a progression from agents making recommendations going

04:46
to a human user for validating and then calling an

04:49
action. Not because we are scared but because they are

04:51
like idiot savants. Sometimes they can be extremely smart. Sometimes

04:55
they can be extremely dumb. And you have no idea

04:57
right now how to distinguish between these 2 scenarios. So

04:59
what he's talking about is these assisted systems where you

05:02
have a human in the loop where you'll have AI,

05:04
an agent that can do all of these these things

05:06
behind the scenes. And then it basically just pushes something

05:08
into the queue for a human to validate it and

05:11
check it and say, yes that's correct. Or give some

05:13
feedback if it is incorrect. This is an assisted system

05:15
where all of the boring stuff is being done by

05:17
the agent and the human is using the final touch.

05:20
Maybe seeing how this agent outcome fits into the broader

05:22
strategy that is kind of hard to get condensed into

05:25
the agent's reasoning and the prompt given to it. This

05:27
gives you a really clear idea of of where things

05:29
are going at least according to Daniel Dines and I'd

05:32
say that he's he's pretty well tapped in. So let's

05:34
explore some real world examples of these kinds of assisted

05:37
systems. Firstly, we have sales development which is a traditional

05:39
role would be a SDR or sales development representative who's

05:42
manually researching prospects, writing personalized emails, and following up with

05:46
them, typically manage maybe 20 to 30 prospects per day.

05:49
The assistant approach is an AI sales assistant

05:52
that automatically research prospects across LinkedIn, company websites, and new

05:55
sources, identifies their highest potential prospects according to the qualification

05:59
criteria to reach out to. It drafts the personalized outreach

06:03
messages based on the research that it did. It suggests

06:05
optimal sending times, repairs the follow-up messages, and it maintains

06:08
the CRM data. The actual human SDR then reviews and

06:12
refines the AI generated content, handles the responses and conversations,

06:15
makes strategic decisions about targeting, and builds relationships with promising

06:18
leads. So the result would be that 1 SDR can

06:20
manage a hundred or more prospects daily while delivering high

06:23
quality interactions with them. So in this case, you'll see

06:27
in a second that people have even gone so far

06:29
to just completely automate this SDR process.

06:32
But this is an example of a assisted 1 where

06:35
there is still a human in the loop. Depending on

06:36
the business or the brand, you wouldn't want AI just

06:39
running a market and going crazy on on their accounts.

06:42
You may wanna have a human in the loop like

06:43
this.

06:44
Then for another business function of content creation, the traditional

06:47
approach would be that a marketing team members will spend

06:50
hours writing their blog post or social media content and

06:53
email newsletters from scratch. The assisted approach will be with

06:55
an AI writing assistant that generates the initial drafts based

06:58
on outlines. And it could even be going out there

07:00
and and monitoring competitors and pulling in information,

07:03
doing live researching using perplexity or other deep researching, models

07:07
as well. It's gonna generate these initial drafts and suggest

07:10
headlines and hooks, create variations for the AB testing, checking

07:14
the gram and readability of course. Then the human marketers

07:16
come in and they edit and refine this content and

07:18
they can add unique and insights and examples from their

07:20
own experience and add that human touch. And they can

07:22
come in and ensure the factual accuracy of things as

07:24
well and ensure the consistent brand voice according to the

07:27
sort of biggest strategy that they're trying to execute on.

07:29
The result would be the team can produce 5 times

07:31
more content while maintaining quality and authenticity.

07:34
So this does most of the leg work. These guys

07:36
just come in and pick the best articles, refine it,

07:38
tweak it, add the touch, make sure it's up to

07:40
standard and they can get a ton more out than

07:42
they would have done before. So getting into the economics

07:44
of assisted systems.

07:46
The key economic advantage of assisted systems lies in their

07:48
ability to multiply human effectiveness without completely removing human judgment.

07:52
This creates several important benefits. Firstly, we have improved economics.

07:56
You've got a high output per employee. 1 person can

07:58
do the work of 3 to 4 people in manual

08:00
systems. You have much more predictable quality. AI is ensuring

08:03
consistent formatting, tone and completeness while humans add personality and

08:06
do the kind of final checks over. And it's overall

08:08
a better use of human talent. You get staff to

08:10
focus on high value work instead of the repetitive tasks

08:13
leading to high job satisfaction and ultimately employee retention. No

08:17
1 likes to do boring crap that doesn't need to

08:18
be done. Right? So that allows them to work more

08:20
creatively, work on high value tasks rather than manual boring

08:23
stuff. And we have much more manageable investment. We have

08:26
lower upfront costs for these systems as they can be

08:28
implemented for a much lower cost than fully automated systems.

08:31
That's because there's a human in the loop. The need

08:33
for absolute perfection each time that it runs is is

08:35
not needed. Right? So, with the assisted systems, someone's there

08:37
checking it. It doesn't need to be engineered to the

08:39
point that it's absolutely flawless which is what you need

08:42
to do with automated systems. You get faster implementation time

08:44
as well as systems are are helpers, not full automations

08:47
with deep integrations. They can be stood up a lot

08:49
faster. And you get easier team adoption where staff sees

08:51
AI as a helpful tool rather than a replacement dealing

08:54
with the human factor that we discussed before.

08:57
In this reduced risks where you're getting human oversight that

08:59
prevents major errors, it's easier to adjust and optimize, and

09:02
clear fallback options if systems fail, and progressive learning curve

09:05
for the organization. They can start off with these assisted

09:07
systems before moving into automated systems later on. Here we

09:10
can see that the AI assisted employee might be able

09:12
to do 5 times as much as the employee would

09:15
be able to do manually.

09:16
Then we get into automated systems which is the future

09:18
state. And automated systems are ones where AI operates independently

09:22
with minimal or no human intervention handling entire processes from

09:25
start to finish. So while the idea of fully automated

09:27
systems is appealing, imagine having a business that ran itself.

09:30
The current state of AI technology means that we must

09:33
be selective about what we automate. Understanding these limitations is

09:36
crucial for implementing automated systems successfully. So the current state

09:39
of automation is that full automation works best for high

09:41
volume and repetitive tasks, processes with clear rules and boundaries,

09:45
situations where speed trumps perfection, and cases where the cost

09:48
of occasional errors is low. This is an important 1

09:50
and really 1 of the defining characteristics of something that's

09:53
suitable for automation is that what happens if this doesn't

09:55
work? If the automation breaks or something goes wrong, is

09:58
it gonna post some content that is just absolutely garbage

10:00
and could really damage the brand? If there's a high

10:02
risk or say if it's a contract or something that

10:04
could potentially really put the business in a bad position,

10:06
you wouldn't want to fully automate those things which is

10:09
when assisted systems are much better. So Daniel Dynes, the

10:11
CEO of UiPath explains that the sweet spot for RPA

10:13
or robotic process automation, which you can think of just

10:16
sort of the more basic rule based automations that we

10:18
would do that don't necessarily have tons of creative writing

10:21
or it's rule based. Right? It's a lot more basic.

10:23
The sweet spot for this is to automate tasks that

10:24
span multiple business systems and are of medium to complex

10:27
to medium to high complexity. They can span multiple steps.

10:30
It can be even a hundred to 200 steps, but

10:32
the key is that they are rule based. The input

10:34
is structured and then the steps that you go through

10:36
are rule based. These automations are very reliable. They simply

10:39
work until the underlying system changes. This is, a quick

10:42
note here even, RPA versus small business automation. RPA, what

10:46
Daniel Dynes here is talking about is enterprise grade automation

10:48
software used by large organizations to automate complex processes across

10:52
multiple business systems. You can think of that as automating

10:54
workflows like your Salesforce and across internal databases as well.

10:58
Now, while similar in concept, most AI automation agencies offer

11:01
more focused solutions that are faster to implement and better

11:04
suited for small to medium sized businesses. Typically connecting a

11:06
few key systems using tools like Zapier or make dot

11:09
com rather than requiring enterprise wide implementations. So that's just

11:12
a quick note on the difference. You see he's talking

11:14
about a hundred to 200 steps. We wouldn't necessarily be

11:16
doing that. I just wanted to point this out as

11:18
he's talking about rule based. They can be very complex

11:20
but they are rule based. Right? The input is structured

11:23
and the steps echo by are rule based and these

11:25
will work until the underlying system changes. The difference between

11:28
rule based and then a more creative and advanced even

11:31
ones that you want to plug agents into. It's where

11:34
there's it's much more difficult and it's not necessarily strictly

11:37
rule based, which is where we have these kind of

11:39
hybrid workflows, in assisted systems. So let's examine a real

11:42
world example that illustrates the power and limitations of current

11:46
automation. So let's say we have an AI appointment setting

11:48
system. It's a medical clinic's booking system and the manual

11:51
approach would be for receptionist to answer the calls during

11:54
business hours. It's gonna book appointments in the scheduling software.

11:56
They'll handle basic insurance questions and they'll be missing after

11:59
hours calls which equals some kind of lost business for

12:01
them. The automated approach would be an AI voice agent

12:03
that answers calls 24 7, books appointments based on availability,

12:07
handles common questions, escalates to complex issues over to staff,

12:10
and sends confirmation text and emails. And the results of

12:12
that, it's obviously never gonna miss a call. It can

12:14
handle multiple languages by default. It books appointments while staff

12:17
sleep. It can handle multiple calls simultaneously. So, it can

12:20
sort of scale to the load as the the calls

12:22
increase during certain periods. And overall, you're gonna get more

12:25
appointments booked because of all these factors. The limitations are

12:27
that it's not going to handle complex questions. It would

12:29
still need some kind of escalation feature. And it's likely

12:32
that some customers will be put off by speaking to

12:34
an AI agent. So there is a slight loss there.

12:35
But the technology is getting so good nowadays, won't be

12:38
long before they're indistinguishable.

12:40
So the reality check here is not everything should be

12:42
fully automated or at least not yet. The key is

12:45
understanding where automation makes sense based on the volume and

12:48
complexity. High volume and a routine tasks are prime automation

12:51
candidates, whereas complex judgment heavy work is often gonna benefit

12:54
more from assisted approaches. Error tolerance. Can the business handle

12:58
occasional AI mistakes in this process? What's the cost of

13:00
an error? These factors help determine if the full automation

13:02
of the system is appropriate and customer preferences as well.

13:05
Some interactions should maintain a human element even if technically

13:08
automatable. Understanding your customer's comfort with AI is crucial. So,

13:11
there's obviously some functions that you wouldn't want to fully

13:13
automate it even if you could, at least at this

13:15
stage. The very personal touch aspects of certain businesses depending

13:18
on the niche and the business itself as well. Like

13:20
you wouldn't try to make an AI customer success manager

13:23
for a super high ticket program. Like imagine if you

13:25
guys came in here and we're like, oh yeah. We

13:27
had humans and then we kinda got rid of it

13:29
because we thought we could just give you an AI

13:30
instead. So while we probably could automate a bunch of

13:33
the functions of it, it's not really right for the

13:35
business. So the transformation journey. As AI automation agency owners,

13:38
our role is to help businesses thoughtfully integrate AI into

13:41
the operations. This isn't about automating everything, it's about choosing

13:44
the right approach for each business process. Some high volume

13:46
and rule based tasks are perfect candidates for automation. Think

13:49
about appointment booking or data entry where speed and 24

13:51
7 operation create clear value. Many complex processes benefit from

13:55
AI assistance rather than full automation. Here, AI handles routine

13:58
aspects while humans maintain oversight and handle expectations. This human

14:02
in the loop approach often delivers the best results by

14:04
combining AI efficiency with human judgment. The most sophisticated tasks

14:07
should remain primarily human driven with AI providing support through

14:10
research, analysis, and recommendations.

14:12
This preserves the strategic thinking and relationship management that humans

14:15
do best. Success comes from carefully evaluating each process and

14:18
implementing the right level of AI integration and automation, while

14:21
ensuring every step creates measurable business value. And I like

14:24
this sort of meme here of, working on a 1

14:26
off project. I should probably automate the steps so I

14:28
can save 6 minutes next time. And then of course

14:30
3 hours later, are you done with the automation yet?

14:32
Not yet? Last few bugs? 6 hours later, why didn't

14:35
you just do it manually? Like go away, no. So,

14:37
this is a very easy trap to fall into where

14:39
full automation as in it's gonna take a lot of

14:41
resources and effort to automate the process. Within businesses, you

14:44
have things that are chopping and changing within each sort

14:47
of month to quarter that are more project based or

14:49
this might be seasonal. Some of these are not they're

14:51
not really suitable for automation because there's so much investment

14:54
involved. If say, you know that you are going to

14:56
need to keep making content for a very long time.

14:59
Okay, well that's a process. Like what's not gonna change

15:01
about the business? That's really where you should be looking

15:03
to automate first. That's gonna create the most value because

15:06
the upfront investment is gonna be spread across the entire

15:08
lifetime that they're doing that task.

15:10
So now getting into the future of AI automation. So

15:12
as this technology continues to advance, we'll see more tasks

15:15
becoming suitable for full automation with new capabilities and better

15:18
performance. Like the improvements in AI technology is gonna make

15:21
it possible to fully automate more tasks. Right? There's limitations

15:24
right now. We're gonna get better infrastructure to build on,

15:26
e. G. The release of the assistance API back in

15:28
20 23, late 20 23 was a massive leap forward

15:31
and basically combined all of this stuff that us as

15:34
agencies at the time were doing into 1 platform that

15:36
allowed us to create agents with knowledge, tools, and clear

15:38
prompting all into 1, via an easy to use or

15:41
fairly easy to use API. So, this is really helping

15:43
us massively as agencies because it allows us to do

15:46
more with less. Right? We have the the infrastructure or

15:48
the rails that we can build on top of for

15:49
our clients. We're gonna see more sophisticated decision making capabilities

15:52
from these models. We already see this with these thinking

15:55
models that can reason for minutes or or even hours

15:57
now. I think they're stretching this out to like 6

15:59
hours where the AI can just think and think and

16:01
think and think and think. So as that window expands

16:03
and it's expanding rapidly, once you can give it enough

16:06
context and it can think for long enough, it's gonna

16:07
be able to make much more sophisticated decisions than even

16:09
humans can make. And, we're gonna see improved handling of

16:12
edge cases ideally coming through the infrastructure that we get.

16:14
But also the increased intelligence of the models can also

16:17
help with that a lot. And, of course, we're gonna

16:19
see out of the box SaaS products that are built

16:20
on top of APIs for specific use cases. So, you're

16:23
gonna see more and more people who maybe take the

16:25
AI receptionist

16:27
platform or format and say okay I have here as

16:30
a You can build AI voice receptionist on our platform.

16:33
Right? So, that might be a wrap around even VAPI

16:35
or they build their own voice AI underneath. That's similar

16:37
to this infrastructure 1 where basically people are gonna build

16:39
SaaS products that allow you to more easily deliver,

16:42
certain types of automation and handle a lot of those

16:44
edge cases for you. Right? It might be something like

16:47
a SaaS. I've seen SaaS where allows you to take

16:49
payments over the phone. That's something that you would normally

16:51
have to build yourself but as these new SaaS product

16:53
come out, they are simplifying key parts that were once

16:55
difficult for us and us as agency owners become kind

16:58
of aggregators and assemblers of systems rather than the people

17:01
doing a ridiculous amount of leg work. So many commentators

17:04
right now are stating that with the early stage of

17:06
AI technology right now, we are in this AI assisted

17:09
era like I've been explaining in this video. However, in

17:11
the next 3 to 5 years, we will enter the

17:13
AI first era that will really see AI integrated throughout

17:15
businesses. So, this graph is a great 1. We have

17:18
human first assisted by machines. This is the manual systems

17:20
we've had for a very, very long time with machines

17:22
used here and there as possible. Right now, we are

17:24
in the AI assisted phase and soon we're gonna be

17:27
AI first where instead of just AI assisting us to

17:29
do things, it's gonna be AI first where it's we

17:31
rethink processes and rethink businesses from the ground up. Actually,

17:34
we're gonna cover it in the next bit so I

17:36
won't dig into it too deeply here. But there's a

17:38
few phases and we're AI assisted right now and soon

17:40
it's going to be AI first. So the lesson here

17:42
is that to capitalize on the AI first era, companies

17:44
need to begin their journeys now. This involves developing expertise

17:47
and constructing modern infrastructure or rails to support AI systems.

17:51
Like having some kind of easily integratable database, something like

17:54
an Airtable, for small businesses particularly. That's gonna allow the

17:57
AI systems to access data as needed easily through tools

17:59
and through APIs. The process starts by transitioning

18:02
current manual systems to assisted and automated systems to the

18:05
extent that the current technology permits. So let's dig a

18:07
little bit deeper into this AI first concept.

18:11
Okay. So an AI first future. Beyond just improving existing

18:15
processes, AI is enabling entirely new ways of building and

18:18
operating businesses. We're moving towards a future where companies won't

18:21
simply add AI to their operations,

18:23
they'll be built from the ground up around AI capabilities.

18:26
This is known as an AI first business. A company

18:29
that is built from the ground up with AI at

18:31
its operational core rather than as a bolt on tool.

18:33
Let's compare traditional versus AI first approaches across key business

18:37
functions. So with the traditional business, you'd have a human

18:39
sales team, a human customer support team, you'd be doing

18:42
a lot of your operations,

18:43
through maybe basic automation or through manual systems like we've

18:46
talked about. And then AI first businesses will be rethinking

18:49
these departments from the ground up with AI at their

18:51
core rather than as nice add ons. Rather than just

18:54
saying, oh, let's assist our human sales teams with AI.

18:57
Let's replace the whole bloody sales team with just an

18:59
AI agent. Right? And same goes for other departments. First

19:01
off with sales and marketing, in the traditional company, you'd

19:04
have large sales team working territory by policy with manual

19:07
outreach. And for the AI first company, you'd see have

19:09
a small team overseeing AI systems that can handle prospecting,

19:12
outreach, and lead nurturing at unlimited scale. And for customer

19:15
support, the traditional route would be having a support team

19:18
handling queries during business hours. And the AI first equivalent

19:21
would be 24 7 AI support handling almost all issues

19:24
instantly with human experts focusing on complex cases only. And

19:27
for operations, you'd have a traditional business, having multiple departments

19:30
coordinating work with regular meetings. And the AI first business

19:33
will be doing automated workflows, connecting all processes with humans

19:36
focusing on strategy and optimization. So the competitive advantage of

19:39
this AI first business is that they have increased operational

19:42
efficiency. You're gonna have lower operational costs, much smaller teams

19:46
like we talked about earlier, near instant scaling without overhead,

19:49
that flexibility to adapt to increases and decreases in demand

19:52
without being caught up short or having overextended and having

19:55
too many people on board. And 24 7 global operations

19:58
by default. For the customer experience, they're gonna get immediate

20:00
responses to all inquiries. You're gonna have much more consistent

20:03
service quality and personalization

20:05
of the customer journey and customer experience at scale because

20:08
AI is being used across all touch points. And market

20:10
adaptability is 1 of the competitive advantages as well. They

20:13
get real time responses to market changes. They can update

20:16
their systems rapidly. They can continuously optimize all of their

20:19
systems and using that data that comes back from it

20:21
and rapidly test and iterate on new versions and slight

20:24
adjustments to optimize it. And the strategic imperative here is

20:27
that it creates an urgent challenge for existing businesses to

20:29
transform towards this version or to risk obsolescence in the

20:33
near future. Just as traditional retailers struggled against Amazon, traditional

20:37
service businesses and even product based businesses will struggle against

20:40
AI first competitors who can deliver better services and products

20:43
at lower costs,

20:44
faster response times, more personalized experiences

20:47
and global reach without increased complexity. And a great example

20:50
of this kind of rethinking from the ground up of

20:52
a business model based on a new technology

20:54
was Warby Parker and how they sort of revolutionized the

20:57
consumer experience of buying glasses. So I've got a little

21:00
chatty bitty, output here. Basically, Warby Parker was an e

21:04
commerce brand that sold eyewear and they were going into

21:06
the market that was dominated by giants where they controlled

21:08
all the design and manufacturing and consumers were paying 3

21:11
to 500 dollars for designer frames despite ridiculously low manufacturing

21:14
costs. And they saw an opportunity to step in and

21:17
use a digital first model, a direct to consumer model

21:20
that cut out all of that fluff in between, cut

21:22
out the stores and become an online only retailer and

21:25
offering high quality frames for only 95 dollars. So they

21:28
own these sort of end to end customer relationship digitally

21:31
and they priced aggressively while still investing in premium materials

21:34
and designs. That good quality product but they moved everything

21:37
online and cut out a lot of those costs. They

21:39
innovated with things like at home try on and virtual

21:41
try ons of glasses. And this home try on was

21:43
awesome because customers could select 5 frames online and then

21:46
try them on at home for 5 days and ship

21:48
back what they didn't want free of charge. And so

21:50
this was a logistic challenge of course but it allowed

21:52
them to have this massive advantage of obviously being seriously

21:56
underpriced compared to these other competitors

21:59
while having a fully online business model removing all that

22:02
cost of having stores and locations and staff. And they

22:04
rethought the entire business model essentially from the ground up

22:07
to be digitally native and removing that physical necessity of

22:11
these stores. And this has happened time and time again

22:13
where where brands and industries are rethought based off technologies.

22:16
This guy is like the richest man man in New

22:17
Zealand.

22:18
There's a guy Nick Mowbray and he took this exact

22:20
same approach but with just general digital first approach to

22:23
businesses. He's done it in like pet food and nappies

22:25
where instead of just being, going up against these incumbents

22:28
and say the nappies industry

22:31
magazines and on TV and really the traditional way of

22:34
making a consumer goods brand. He came in and said,

22:36
look the future is digital. We're gonna sell to millennials.

22:38
Yeah. For example, this is 1 of the brands and

22:40
they rethought this pet food and they made this nude

22:43
brand. And had this really colorful nice branding and packaging

22:46
and all the advertising is very sort of digital first

22:48
and appeal to this millennial market. And and this combined

22:51
with the digital marketing strategy allowed them to become, I

22:54
believe they are the number 1 pet food brand in

22:56
the country right now and they've gone all over the

22:58
place, all over the world as well. So this practice

23:00
of rethinking a business model or rethinking an industry,

23:04
with a new technology. In this case, using the latest

23:06
in digital marketing and the Willy Parker example,

23:09
using e commerce as in sort of being able to

23:11
buy products online and and how sophisticated that industry had

23:15
become. Using that as the lever

23:17
to make a differentiated business that is sort of forward

23:20
facing and uses the latest technology to to have a

23:22
competitive advantage. So there is a window of opportunity here

23:25
where for the next sort of 2 to 3 years,

23:27
there's this transition period where the early movers like Warby

23:30
Parker and like Nude Pet Food,

23:32
are going to successfully transform their operations and be able

23:35
to capture significant market share with their AI first versions

23:38
and build sustainable advantages. Like you can

23:41
go up against the the big guys in industries with

23:44
these kinds of businesses and then these transitions

23:46
where you just completely rethink it. Where as someone who's

23:50
restarting from 0 with AI at the absolute core of

23:52
everything you do, you have a a huge advantage as

23:55
the technology improves compared to the old guys because they

23:57
have all of these staff and all these people and

23:59
all these systems that have spent millions and millions of

24:01
dollars to set up. And for them to rip that

24:03
down is a very difficult thing to do not only

24:06
physically but also kind of politically within the organization. How

24:09
you could get the buy in for majority of the

24:12
company to be ripped down at the expense of jobs

24:14
and

24:15
huge departments and and tons of effort that's been put

24:17
in. There is a big opportunity for people like us

24:19
to rethink these industries using AI first business models. And

24:22
those who wait are going to risk falling permanently behind

24:25
and that's potentially some of the clients that you won't

24:27
end up signing. And it's your job to help to

24:29
communicate this to your clients, to get them to invest

24:31
the money required to secure their business's future.

24:34
So the key takeaways from this section is that the

24:36
evolution of work through AI represents a fundamental transition in

24:39
how businesses operate. Understanding the progression

24:42
is crucial for guiding businesses through effective digital transformation. So

24:45
we've got the 3 stages of work, manual systems, traditional

24:47
human driven processes that follow standard operating procedures while they're

24:50
reliable for everything from mundane tasks to complex decision making,

24:53
they face natural limits and scale consistency and operating hours.

24:56
So great to start off with but as businesses scale,

24:59
they need something a bit more robust and AI can

25:01
really help out there through assisted systems. So today's optimal

25:04
approach is where AI handles the routine task, researching data

25:07
entry, drafting, etcetera while humans maintain the control with a

25:11
human in the loop kind of model. This combination multiplies

25:13
human effectiveness, improves quality, and maintains crucial oversight,

25:17
for having the humans in there too. And it's perfect

25:19
for more complex processes like sales and content creation. Or

25:22
for example, contract drafting as well. And finally, we have

25:25
automated systems which are complete AI handling

25:28
of tasks with minimal human intervention,

25:30
ideal for high volume rule based tasks with speed and

25:32
24 7 operation create clear value. While powerful, it requires

25:36
careful process selection and robust implementation.

25:38
Examples of this include extracting personal information from resumes for

25:42
database insertion. And the implementation reality is that success requires

25:45
matching each process with the right level of AI integration,

25:48
building systems that can evolve as technology advances, building systems

25:51
that can evolve as technology advances, balancing automation with customer

25:54
preferences,

25:55
and starting the journey now to capture early advantages. We

25:57
also covered the AI first future where businesses won't just

26:00
use AI, they'll be built around it from the ground

26:03
up. And early movers who transform their operations

26:05
now will capture significant advantages in cost scale and consumer

26:08
experiences

26:09
as things progress and as the technology improves. That's really

26:12
the key point is that if you got the base

26:13
there and it's working enough that it's only going to

26:16
get easier. Right? As better technology comes out. And the

26:18
agency opportunity here is to guide businesses through this transformation

26:21
by getting them to understand the future. We're headed towards

26:24
them, why they need to act now, helping them understand

26:27
the different types of systems and their strengths and weaknesses

26:29
and saying, hey. Maybe we shouldn't go full automated here.

26:31
It's not quite ready. We can get much better results

26:33
for a fraction of the cost and it's gonna be

26:35
faster to set up with this assisted and we can

26:38
also ease your team into using AI a lot better.

26:40
Implementing the right level of automation for the task like

26:42
I just said and building the foundations and rails so

26:45
that the business is prepared for this AI first future.
