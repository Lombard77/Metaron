00:00
Hello, everyone. My name is Nico, and welcome to the

00:02
second video in this module, which is outreach theory.

00:06
In this video, we're going to be covering the foundation

00:09
of outreach, which is research.

00:12
We're gonna cover how you build your contact lists, the

00:15
outreach metrics and KPIs, what are they, how do you

00:19
troubleshoot,

00:20
how do you look for them, how do you track

00:21
them, all the good stuff that goes under that, as

00:24
well as

00:30
copywriting, personalization,

00:32
all the juice. And lastly, we're gonna be having a

00:34
look at your digital footprints,

00:37
meaning

00:37
where are you on social media? How can people find

00:39
you? Because when you do outreach,

00:41
believe it or not, people actually look you up.

00:44
Let's hop into it. So here is the outreach theory

00:47
document.

00:49
As a bit of an introduction, in the world of

00:51
business, particularly

00:52
in the AI space, your ability to connect with potential

00:56
clients

00:57
can make or break your business. Outreach is the bridge

01:00
between your skills and the market that needs them. Mastering

01:04
this art isn't just about sending emails or making calls,

01:08
it's about strategically

01:10
positioning yourself to capture opportunities

01:12
in a rapidly evolving landscape.

01:15
In this video, we'll dive deep into the fundamental concepts

01:19
and strategies

01:21
that underpin successful outreach campaigns.

01:24
Understanding these principles is essential for crafting effective outreach,

01:28
especially in the AI automation agency model. By the end

01:31
of this video, you'll have a comprehensive

01:34
understanding

01:35
of how to effectively reach out to potential clients,

01:38
build relationships,

01:40
and ultimately

01:41
grow your triple a.

01:43
In this video, we're going to explore the importance of

01:46
research, understanding

01:48
your prospect deeply,

01:50
where to go for research, where to look, what you

01:53
need to know.

01:54
Then we're gonna go through crafting compelling messages,

01:57
creating outreach that actually gets responses.

02:01
We're gonna walk through and talk about personalization

02:03
at scale,

02:05
making each prospect feel valued and that message is only

02:09
written for them.

02:10
The outreach funnel as a whole from first contact to

02:13
close deal. We're gonna go through metrics and optimization

02:17
using KPIs to improve our actual outreach.

02:20
And then lastly, we're gonna go through some tools and

02:23
automations.

02:25
Leveraging tech

02:27
without losing the human touch.

02:30
The foundation of outreach is research.

02:32
And when it comes to outreach,

02:34
knowledge

02:35
is power.

02:37
Conducting

02:37
in-depth research

02:39
is crucial for understanding your audience

02:42
and tailoring your approach accordingly.

02:44
In this section, we'll explore the importance

02:47
of research in outreach and provide frameworks for gathering the

02:52
insights

02:53
you need to succeed.

02:55
Target audience research. To create effective campaigns,

02:58
you need you absolutely need, there's no way around it,

03:01
a deep understanding

03:03
of the businesses

03:04
you're targeting.

03:06
Developing this understanding requires thorough research into various aspects of

03:11
their operations

03:12
and their markets.

03:14
Here's a couple of questions you can ask yourself.

03:17
How do they prospect for new clients?

03:20
What are their typical profit margins?

03:22
How do they market their services?

03:25
What is their service delivery process? What are the key

03:28
benefits of their service?

03:30
Who are their main competitors?

03:31
What is the current state of their markets?

03:34
How do their competitors differentiate themselves from the company you

03:37
were looking to reach out to? Right? This is just

03:40
to get a full understanding of the market.

03:42
A good rule of thumb is to conduct research until

03:45
you feel confident enough to start a business

03:49
in that niche yourself.

03:52
This level of understanding

03:54
allows you to identify areas for improvement and position your

03:58
AI services as a valuable solution.

04:01
Now it's important that we don't get caught up in

04:03
this. We don't want to research the business model, the

04:06
niche for 5 years because we wanna be in a

04:09
way different place in 5 years than what we are

04:11
now. Right? And there's a fine line between doing the

04:14
research and actually reaching out. But what I'm seeing through

04:17
having hundreds, if not even thousands of coaching calls,

04:20
is that people tend to skip this step because it's

04:23
boring.

04:24
If you skip this step, you should sign a waiver

04:27
that says, I know I'm not gonna get results as

04:29
quick as the people would do. Because the truth about

04:32
this is if you misunderstand

04:34
something about the niche and you give them an offer

04:36
they won't resonate with, that's gonna keep you back for

04:39
weeks until you realize it. There's a hundred different aspects

04:42
that are playing in here, which essentially if you understand

04:45
all of the different aspects with it, you're gonna be

04:47
able to steer clear and avoid these pitfalls

04:50
that a lot of people fall into.

04:53
So if I were to start everything all over again,

04:55
the absolute first place I would start is I would

04:57
do the research on the audience I'm looking to target.

05:00
Ideal customer profiles, your ICP.

05:03
Once you've gained a deep understanding of your target market,

05:05
the next step is to define the specific

05:08
type of businesses

05:10
that's ideal

05:11
for your triple a services.

05:14
This is where your ideal customer profile or ICP

05:19
comes into play. Your ICP

05:21
will help you ensure your outreach efforts are targeting the

05:25
right businesses,

05:26
maximizing your efficiency and effectiveness

05:29
of your campaigns.

05:31
Customer is a person or a business that pay

05:34
for your product or your service.

05:37
An ICP, an ideal customer profile, is the ideal business

05:41
that gets given maximum value from your offering. It's the

05:45
optimal clients, the perfect client, if you will.

05:50
There's a couple of ICP attributes.

05:53
Creating an accurate ICP requires thorough research and should not

05:58
be based on guesswork. Inaccuracies in your ICP can lead

06:01
to ineffective outreach and wasted resources.

06:05
Considering the following factors when defining your ICP,

06:09
what kind of business type is this? Is this a

06:11
b to b company, meaning do they sell to other

06:13
businesses? Or is it a b to b to c

06:15
company that sells to consumers and non businesses?

06:18
What specific industry or industries

06:21
does your ideal customer operates in? For example, health care,

06:25
finance, retail, manufacturing, you get the point. When it comes

06:29
to company size,

06:30
this should be measured by how many employees

06:34
or

06:34
annual revenue.

06:35
A small business might have 1 to 50 employees, while

06:39
an enterprise could have 1000

06:41
employees plus.

06:44
Revenue. What's the typical annual revenue of your ideal customer?

06:48
This helps ensure you're targeting

06:50
businesses that can actually afford your solution.

06:54
Location.

06:56
Where are your ideal customers located? This could be geographic

07:00
regions,

07:01
countries,

07:02
or even as specific as cities.

07:05
Technology stack. What technologies or softwares does your ideal customer

07:09
currently use?

07:11
This is particularly important for tech companies to ensure

07:15
compatibility

07:16
or identify opportunities

07:18
for integration.

07:19
Bit of a side note on this, but this is

07:21
actually a very underused strategy.

07:23
But if you look into different platforms

07:25
that your audience generally uses,

07:28
you can figure out and pick out specific pinpoints they

07:31
would have from using the software that you can reach

07:34
out to them and you can say, hey, I see

07:36
you're using this software. I'd love to fix this problem

07:38
you have, which is a very good strategy for reaching

07:41
out to people and segmentation, which is something we're gonna

07:43
talk a lot more about later. But just keep that

07:46
in the back of mind that this is actually quite

07:48
underused.

07:49
Really think about when it comes to ICP and defining

07:51
them, really think about what tech do they actually use

07:54
within their company at this moment.

07:57
Decision makers.

07:59
Who would be the key decision makers

08:01
for the purchase?

08:04
This could be roles like CEO, CTO, head of operation.

08:08
It could even be manager if you're contacting a bigger

08:11
size company.

08:12
And lastly, it is pain points. What specific problems or

08:16
challenges does your ideal customer

08:19
face

08:19
that your product or service can solve? In a nutshell,

08:22
this is really what we're doing when we're building a

08:24
company, isn't it? We're reaching out to people with a

08:26
problem and we're saying we can fix it.

08:29
When it comes to to figuring out all of this

08:31
information that we've just now talked about,

08:34
we've got ICP research data sources.

08:37
To gather the information needed to create and refine your

08:41
ICP, it's crucial to leverage a variety

08:45
of data sources. As discussed earlier,

08:47
deep research

08:49
and understanding

08:51
are absolute

08:52
key and cannot be skipped.

08:55
So here are several data sources

08:57
that you can use to gain that understanding.

09:00
Sales data, analyze your existing customer base if you already

09:04
have 1 or look back at the sales calls you've

09:07
had if you have had any to identify

09:09
patterns and characteristics.

09:11
Look for factors like the industry that we're in, the

09:14
company size that you were talking to, and the lifetime

09:17
value of a customer for them,

09:20
as well as objections. This is often very overlooked, but

09:23
you're getting a good understanding of their objections. And what

09:25
people typically bring up will actually give you a very

09:28
good indication of how to combat and solve this in

09:31
outreach. Because 1 of the things about outreach, which is

09:33
obviously the topic of this video,

09:36
is when we're reaching out to people,

09:39
instead of saying no or giving an objection, they will

09:42
actually just not reply.

09:44
So

09:45
fighting or combating objections

09:47
as we're sending out our message

09:50
or disarming them of the objection they have when they

09:53
read our message is something that will help us get

09:55
more replies. So keeping a very close eye on objections

09:58
is is a bit of a thing you can put

09:59
in your back pocket.

10:01
Customer support feedback.

10:03
Monitor

10:04
all their companies support forums for pain points, feature requests,

10:08
and use cases.

10:10
That can reveal

10:11
what your ideal customer value most. This is a very

10:14
good 1. So if you know that your audience uses

10:17
a specific platform or they spend time in a specific

10:20
place,

10:20
go to that platform, go to that place

10:23
and look at what do these guys complain about, what

10:26
do they value, what would they be willing to pay

10:29
for, What is going on? This is gonna help you

10:31
get a great understanding of what actual problems are coming

10:35
as we talked about earlier, not just from the platforms

10:37
they use, but overall things they value and care about.

10:41
Surveys. This is another 1 that might be a bit

10:42
out of reach, for some people, but it's a really,

10:45
really great way of getting ahead of information. So conduct

10:48
service with either existing customers

10:51
or warm leads that you know that you can contact

10:54
to gather direct insights about their needs, challenges, and preferences.

10:59
This is something extremely actionable that you can implement right

11:02
away when people tell you. So if you've got anyone

11:04
you can reach out to, anyone you know, that's very

11:06
highly suggested. Competitor analysis.

11:09
Study your competitors'

11:10
customer base and marketing strategies.

11:13
This can help you identify

11:15
underserved segments

11:17
or differentiation

11:18
opportunities.

11:19
1 of the main things about starting your company is

11:21
you wanna put yourself you wanna set yourself apart from

11:23
your competitors. And if you have competitors that have already

11:26
made things work, look at what they are going what

11:29
they are doing to analyze and understand it.

11:32
Customer review websites, platforms like g 2, Capterra, or industry

11:36
specific review platforms

11:38
can provide

11:39
very valuable insights into what customers value in solutions

11:43
similar to yours. Market research platforms utilize platforms

11:48
like Statista

11:49
or IBIS World for industry trends,

11:53
market sizes, or demographic data relative to your ICP.

11:57
Then lastly but not least, we've got forums and social

12:00
media groups. This is probably 1 of the, like, most

12:04
hidden gems you can find all these

12:06
very valuable insights people are talking about that people don't

12:10
really leverage. So monitor relevant online communities to understand your

12:13
target audiences, discussions, challenges, and interests. Creating your ICP. Now

12:17
that you understand the attributes and the data sources for

12:20
your ICP, let's walk through a brief process on how

12:23
we create 1.

12:25
Remember, you should already have decided on a niche

12:29
earlier in the course.

12:31
This process will help you further refine your target within

12:35
that niche.

12:37
First thing is we're gonna define our company characteristics. We're

12:40
gonna outline ideal company size, revenue, and technology readiness, if

12:44
that is relevant.

12:46
Consider factors like location and current tech stack. What I

12:49
mean by tech stack is what platforms do they use.

12:51
We've talked about this a couple of times already, but

12:53
it's what platforms do they use within the company. And

12:55
then we've got identify decision makers. Develop profiles of potential

12:59
decision makers,

13:01
I e

13:02
CTO, operation managers, owners, founders, cofounders,

13:06
whatever floats your boat, relevant to your industry and the

13:10
research you have done.

13:12
Consider the job responsibilities

13:14
and likely concern

13:16
about AI adoption. This is something that's gonna come in

13:19
quite handy the further we go down the outreach route

13:22
because when we get down to the copywriting,

13:24
1 of the things we're gonna be considering and thinking

13:26
about is is AI a good or a bad buzzword

13:29
in this industry,

13:30
Which is why I already wanna start introducing the concepts,

13:32
making sure that you kinda have this in the back

13:34
of your mind.

13:35
Then we've got listing the key pain points. So sit

13:38
down and think about

13:40
what problems

13:42
does this type of company face

13:44
that AI or our AI rather could solve.

13:48
Focus on issues like data processing, customer service, or inventory

13:51
management.

13:52
Most important of all,

13:55
replace this with what is important to your industry. These

13:57
are only examples to help your brain get going on

14:00
what I'm talking about. For your industries, it might be

14:03
something completely different.

14:05
Maybe it is logistics,

14:07
but that won't apply to everyone. So think about your

14:10
industry's pain points is the important thing here.

14:13
And then we've got analyze the buying process. Understand typical

14:17
purchasing journey

14:19
for AI solutions in your target industries.

14:22
The reason this is in here and the reason for

14:24
you to understand this is once you pick different type

14:26
of companies, they're gonna have different buying cycles.

14:30
And the longer the cycle is, the longer it takes

14:32
for you to close a deal.

14:34
And the more hoops you have to jump through, the

14:36
more people you have to talk to. So you writing

14:38
this down on a piece of paper to make sure

14:40
you get this mapped out helps you ensure that what

14:43
you're actually targeting is within and aligned with what you

14:46
want to achieve in the time you want to achieve

14:48
it. Because if you write down here that the purchasing

14:52
process for a company I want to work with happens

14:54
to be 2 years,

14:56
well, you should probably rethink your ICP. Right?

14:59
So identify potential objections or roadblocks in the buying process

15:03
as well as people

15:05
and groups you might have to jump through to be

15:07
allowed to implement the process.

15:09
In health care, this might be that you need to

15:12
talk to a legal department,

15:14
etcetera.

15:15
Again, implement the research about your industry, and then synthesize

15:18
your ICP. Combine all the information together into a concise

15:22
description,

15:23
including the company characteristics,

15:25
the decision maker profile,

15:27
key pinpoints,

15:28
and the buying process insights you've gathered.

15:31
Be prepared to refine this

15:34
as you gain real world experience.

15:37
Very rarely in my life have I seen someone come

15:40
up with an ICP and stick to it for more

15:42
than a year. Very often, they're gonna make decisions based

15:45
on the data they get coming in. Right? They're gonna

15:47
make tweaks. They're gonna make changes. So this is not

15:50
something you're married to. It's not set in stone. It's

15:53
1 of those things that are gonna change as you

15:55
evolve.

15:56
And here's an example of a completed ICP worksheet.

16:00
In the later modules of this outbound systems course,

16:03
you will need to be doing deep ICP research yourself.

16:07
Here's an example of what a finished ICP worksheet should

16:11
look like.

16:12
As you can see, we've gone through and we've highlighted

16:14
this 1, which is b to b instead of b

16:16
to c. So we wanna work with b to b

16:17
companies, then we've listed the industries that we can work

16:20
with, and we've listed out the company size we want

16:24
to work with, which is 50 to 250

16:26
in this case. Then we list out the revenue for

16:28
our ideal customer,

16:30
and then we do location,

16:32
which is main regions, the US and Canada,

16:35
and more specific,

16:37
our absolute ideal customer will be based in tech hubs.

16:41
Then we're looking at the technology stack, and since we're

16:44
in ecom, some of the platforms we're looking at is

16:46
Shopify or WooCommerce, which is big in ecom,

16:50
Salesforce or HubSpot for CRMs, and Google Analytics and Google

16:54
Ads, because in this case, we're looking at people that

16:56
are running ads for RCP. Right?

16:59
The decision maker. Who are the decision makers?

17:02
Since these are companies ranging from 50 to 250

17:05
employees,

17:06
our decision makers

17:07
are chief technology

17:09
officer,

17:10
chief marketing officer, or

17:12
operation manager.

17:16
And then we've got the pain points that we're listing

17:18
out. They do time consuming manual data entry and analysis.

17:22
Pain point number 2 is inconsistent customer service quality and

17:25
response time. And pain 0.3

17:28
is inefficient inventory management leading to stock out

17:32
or overstock,

17:34
which is a logistics problem. Right?

17:37
And then we've got data sources

17:39
we've gone through and we've used. Right? So we've gone

17:41
through and we've used all of these to gather the

17:43
information and as we've gone through and used them, we've

17:45
checked them off.

17:47
Now we combined all of the information we've written down

17:50
and mapped out here above into a brief section that

17:54
we can frame and put in our room.

17:57
This is industry,

17:59
company size, location, decision maker, and pain points. This is

18:02
what is the most crucial part of your ICP.

18:06
And then the action plan of putting your ICP into

18:08
action.

18:09
This is something we're gonna be diving way more into

18:12
later, so don't worry too much about this now, but

18:14
it's gonna help activate your brain for where do you

18:16
actually need to look for ICP, where do you need

18:18
to go to scrape them, all that kind of stuff

18:20
once you have all the information. So first consume this

18:23
information and then you can go do this.

18:26
And then we've got putting your ICP into action.

18:28
Once you've defined your ICP,

18:31
we can use it to focus your outreach efforts on

18:33
prospects who closely match the profile. The closer, the better.

18:37
By targeting the right people, you'll significantly increase your chances

18:41
of success by avoiding wasting time on less than ideal

18:46
leads.

18:47
Right? This is a very real problem.

18:49
And here's how.

18:51
So we're gonna do targeted prospecting. Focusing your outreach efforts

18:54
on prospects who closely match your ICP.

18:56
This targeted approach significantly increases your chances of success

19:00
and helps avoid wasting the time. Right? And then we've

19:03
got tailored messaging, which is craft your outreach messages and

19:06
content

19:07
to address their specific pain points, to address their goals,

19:11
and the characteristics of your ICP.

19:13
This personalization

19:15
can dramatically

19:16
and will dramatically improve your response rates. This is something

19:19
we're gonna be talking a lot more more about later.

19:22
Tailored messaging is

19:24
probably

19:25
1 of arguably 1 of the most important things about

19:27
sending a message. We're gonna talk a lot more about

19:29
tailored messaging messaging later. So this is just, again, how

19:33
to apply this to your ICP.

19:34
Prioritize leads. So use your ICP to score and prioritize

19:39
leads. Prospects who closely match your ICP should receive more

19:42
attention,

19:43
resources, and priority

19:45
than the ones that don't match your ICP.

19:47
This is for you to maximize where your time is

19:49
spent and how much you get back from it. Then

19:52
we've got refine your search. Utilizing your ICP to fine

19:55
tune your search criteria on platforms like LinkedIn or industry

19:58
databases when looking for new prospects

20:00
is absolutely crucial. If we don't know what kind of

20:03
prospects we're looking for and we're looking to gather a

20:05
list of them, what are we even gonna put into

20:07
the search filters?

20:08
Now don't worry about the technical terms like search filters

20:11
and stuff like that. We're gonna be talking all about

20:13
it. But just know if you don't have an ICP,

20:16
how are you gonna curate a list of people to

20:18
reach out to? It is simply impossible.

20:21
And then measure and adjust. So regularly analyze the performance

20:24
of your outreach campaigns against your ICP.

20:28
Use these insights to refine your profile and strategies over

20:32
time.

20:33
What I mean by this is as you're kinda reaching

20:35
out to people,

20:36
it's all about testing. Right? Everything comes down to testing.

20:39
So you could test out different segments or different ICP

20:43
components.

20:44
So maybe you test out a different technology base. Maybe

20:48
you realize the best client is in another industry

20:50
that still needs your solution. So you always want to

20:53
test out, measure, and adjust to improve your ICP over

20:57
time. So a bit of a quick summary

20:59
on this is thorough research and a well defined

21:03
ICP

21:04
is absolutely crucial for outreach campaigns

21:07
and cannot,

21:08
I repeat, cannot be skipped.

21:10
This foundational works enables you to craft targeted messages that

21:14
resonate with your prospects, developer assistable offers,

21:17
identify effective outreach channels and timing,

21:21
build credibility

21:22
by speaking your industry's language.

21:27
Again, this is something we're gonna be talking a lot

21:29
about in just a couple of minutes.

21:31
And then remember, precision

21:33
beats casting a wide net every single day of the

21:35
week.

21:36
Upfront research leads to higher response rates and more close

21:40
deals. And this is my way of saying, like,

21:43
please

21:45
do the upfront research.

21:47
If you don't, you're throwing yourself into a hole you

21:49
don't have to be in.

21:51
And then lastly, we've got continually refine your ICP to

21:54
gain insights. This is something you can put on a

21:57
post it notes and put it on your desk or

21:59
put it on your wall or somewhere where you can

22:00
see it frequently because these are things that are over

22:03
time, not just a 1 time thing.

22:05
With a solid research foundation,

22:07
you'll craft compelling messages

22:09
that drive

22:11
real results for your triple a business. Now let your

22:15
research guide your outreach strategy

22:17
and watch the leads roll in.

22:20
Contacts. Building your contact list.

22:23
When you're just starting with outreach,

22:25
1 of the first things you'll need is a list

22:27
of people to reach out to. This is what we

22:30
call a contact list. Let's break down what this means

22:32
and how to get started. A contact is a person

22:35
or entity

22:37
with potential business relevance.

22:39
Contact list is a database of individuals or organization

22:42
that you can contact through outreach.

22:45
Sourcing contacts. Now that you know what contact lists are,

22:49
let's talk about how you get 1. There are several

22:52
ways to source contacts.

22:54
1 is buying lists.

22:56
You can purchase pre made realists,

22:58
and it's quick, but it might be expensive and at

23:02
least cost some sort of money.

23:04
Then you've got scraping,

23:05
which is you can use software relatively

23:08
cheap compared to buying lists. Then we've got online generation,

23:10
which is build a

23:11
list,

23:20
Then we've got online generation,

23:22
which is build

23:23
a list through your online presence, meaning a newsletter sign

23:26
up, a lead magnet, social media, etcetera.

23:30
These are high intent engaged contacts, which are gonna be

23:33
used for warm outreach,

23:35
but they take a lot of time to build.

23:38
Then we've got networking,

23:41
collecting

23:42
through

23:43
personal interactions.

23:46
This is 1 of those things that are very high

23:48
quality and is very well used in a warm outreach

23:51
scenario,

23:52
but is very time consuming.

23:54
So if you need speed, buy and list. If you

23:56
want a tech approach that doesn't cost as much money,

24:00
scrape.

24:01
If you need something budget friendly

24:03
and don't wanna learn how to use the tech, do

24:05
online generation.

24:07
And lastly, if you want really, really superior high quality

24:11
contacts,

24:12
go networking.

24:13
Meet people, shake their hand, make friends.

24:17
Segmenting.

24:18
Segmenting your list is key to making your outreach more

24:22
relevant

24:23
and personalized.

24:24
By dividing your list into smaller,

24:27
more targeted segments,

24:29
you can tailor your messaging to resonate with each group's

24:33
specific needs,

24:34
interests, or characteristics.

24:38
A segment is a subset

24:40
of your audience with shared

24:43
traits.

24:46
And here's a real world example of what segmentation

24:49
looks like to explain what it is and how to

24:52
use it.

24:53
Instead of having 1 large list for, let's say, real

24:56
estate agents in the US,

24:58
you could create

24:59
separate segments based on company size, location, or specialization.

25:05
This is what

25:07
segmenting is and what you can do it with or

25:10
what you can use

25:12
to have segmented lists.

25:14
These data points. Right?

25:16
This allows you to create

25:18
emails or outreach

25:20
messages that speak directly to the unique challenges

25:24
and opportunities in each segment,

25:27
increasing the likelihood of engagement

25:29
and conversion.

25:31
And I'll give you guys a bit of a real

25:32
world example on this

25:34
other than just showing you what data points to use,

25:37
And that is a company with 1 employee

25:40
will never have the same problem as a company with

25:43
a thousand employees. Well, maybe they will, but the likelihood

25:45
is low. Right? A company with a thousand employees, they're

25:48
gonna have a different decision maker to contact. They're gonna

25:51
have a different pain point they resonate with. They're gonna

25:54
have a different buying process.

25:56
Everything will be very different depending on the industry itself,

25:59
which is again why it's so fundamental and so important

26:01
to do that ground laying research of the industry to

26:04
understand everything about it. 1 of the things you really

26:06
want to consider here is what solution you will provide

26:09
based on these factors.

26:10
So what will make a difference in what you say

26:13
and what you provide depending on your industry?

26:16
In the case of a real estate agent,

26:19
the location

26:21
might be a factor. Let's pretend that 1 market is

26:24
in the high season and a lower another market is

26:27
in the low season. Let's pretend for this case, just

26:29
for demo purposes, that New York currently has a very

26:33
high season where everyone's selling, everyone's buying. It's great in

26:36
the real estate space. While Los Angeles is on a

26:38
downturn,

26:39
meaning there's very little activity in the market. When you're

26:43
contacting real estate agents, your value proposition has to be

26:45
different for these kind of people. Because the people in

26:48
New York,

26:49
because it's such a active market, they might, generally speaking,

26:52
have too many leads to handle, meaning that's a pain

26:54
point. While in Los Angeles, they don't have enough leads.

26:58
So if you reach out to real estate agents in

27:00
Los Angeles saying, I know you have too many leads

27:02
to manage. I'd love to help you out. They're gonna

27:04
say, what do you mean? I don't have any leads.

27:06
The market's dead,

27:08
which is obviously a problem. Right? So you want to

27:10
consider your industry and think about what would cause me

27:13
to bring up or talk about something different

27:16
depending on my industry,

27:18
which is typically speaking, 1 of these things are usually

27:20
something you would have to segment by.

27:23
Another thing to consider is things like decision makers. We're

27:26
gonna talk a lot more about this. I just wanna

27:27
give you some context to what we're actually talking about

27:30
and bringing in the loop here. Another 1 is company

27:32
size. Because when you're reaching out to people, you have

27:33
to reach out to a person, which is something we're

27:35
gonna be talking more about, that decision maker. Right? And

27:38
the decision maker of Facebook

27:40
is not Mark Zuckerberg.

27:42
It's not the owner. If you wanna have Facebook coming

27:45
as a client and you're selling AI,

27:48
Mark Zuckerberg is not gonna make that decision. Someone lower

27:51
down the supply chain will make it. So in the

27:54
case we have a company as massive as Facebook,

27:56
the decision maker might even be like a manager.

27:59
While if you're reaching out to an a company with

28:01
10 employees,

28:03
well,

28:04
the decision maker probably won't be the manager, it will

28:06
probably be the owner. Right? So you want to consider

28:08
your industry and do a bit of research on it

28:09
to figure out considering this segment of market or the

28:12
segment of leads that I have, who would be the

28:15
decision maker and what value proposition and offers do I

28:17
have to give them? Value propositions offers is something we're

28:20
gonna talk a lot more about in a second here.

28:23
Other examples of segmentations

28:25
can include industry, job title or seniority level, pain points

28:29
and challenges, technology use or engagement level. So to sum

28:33
this section up, segmenting your lead list is determining

28:37
what will make a difference in your audience when you

28:40
reach out to them, who you reach out to, and

28:43
build a list

28:45
around that segment of people.

28:48
This specifically

28:49
list building is something we're gonna be talking more about.

28:54
Then we've got outreach metrics

28:57
and KPIs,

28:58
which is a very, very important aspect to outreach. As

29:01
entrepreneurs

29:02
looking to utilize outreach in our acquisition strategy, we're always,

29:06
always looking for ways to measure our success and improve

29:10
the strategies.

29:11
Once you've started your outreach campaigns, you'll want to know

29:14
how well they're working.

29:17
That's where outreach metrics

29:19
and KPIs come in handy.

29:21
Metrics first.

29:23
Understanding metrics is crucial for your outreach campaigns. They provide

29:27
you raw data that helps you gauge the effectiveness

29:30
of your outreach and identify areas of improvements.

29:34
Metrics is a number

29:36
that tells you how your outreach is performing. They're simply

29:39
put like vital signs of your outreach campaign. Here's a

29:42
couple of example of outreach metrics. Open rates, 60 percent,

29:45
reply rates, 4 percent, and sent 200 emails.

29:51
These

29:52
are metrics.

29:54
Now we're gonna talk about the KPIs,

29:56
key performance indicators.

29:58
While metrics give you a broad view of your outreach's

30:02
performance,

30:03
KPIs

30:04
is the metrics

30:06
that truly matter.

30:07
They are the North Star of your outreach efforts directly

30:11
measuring

30:12
what you're ultimately trying to achieve.

30:15
Key performance indicators or KPIs

30:17
are critical measurements that reflect the goal achievements.

30:22
It could be total replies,

30:24
e. G. 7 percent. It could be positive replies, e.

30:28
G. 60 percent, or it could even be deals closed,

30:31
e. G. 3, depending on where you want to take

30:34
your company and where your goals are.

30:37
Generally speaking, positive replies in an outreach campaign is the

30:41
KPI that we're looking for that we can track and

30:43
actually improve. Positive replies is the most used KPI when

30:47
it comes to outreach campaigns because it's very trackable, measurable,

30:50
and it's something really

30:52
it's at the end of the outreach cycle. Right? Once

30:55
you get a positive reply, then they convert into the

30:57
sales cycle, which has a different KPI and is a

31:00
whole different chapter by itself.

31:02
So when we're starting off, 90 percent of the time,

31:04
99 percent of the time, we're gonna be using positive

31:07
replies as our KPI. We're gonna be talking more about

31:09
this and troubleshooting later.

31:12
And then we've got platform specific metrics. Different outreach platforms

31:16
over unique metrics

31:17
that provide valuable insights into your campaign performance.

31:20
Here are a couple of the key metrics

31:23
to track LinkedIn,

31:24
emails, and Instagram.

31:27
This is again metrics. So it means all the numbers

31:29
that compile your campaign and give you insights on what's

31:32
going on, not your KPI, not your ultimate goal.

31:36
Metrics are all the numbers within your campaign, and this

31:40
is what we're gonna use to troubleshoot and improve our

31:42
campaigns so it's important we understand and get this right.

31:45
On LinkedIn,

31:46
we've got accept rate, which is the percentage of connection

31:50
request that are accepted by recipients.

31:53
This gauges your audience

31:55
initial willingness to engage with you on LinkedIn and also

31:58
their activity, which is something we're gonna talk more about.

32:01
And then we've got response rates is a metric we'll

32:03
get on LinkedIn, which is the percentage of people who

32:06
reply to your message regardless of the nature of the

32:08
response, meaning positive, negative, whatever they are reply.

32:11
Then we've got positive reply rates, which is the percentage

32:13
of people who respond positively to your outreach, and this

32:17
on LinkedIn is your KPI,

32:19
again, depending on your goals. If your goal is to

32:22
make a sale,

32:23
your goal is to get a positive

32:25
reply

32:27
as a KPI.

32:28
Then what about emails?

32:29
Reply rates is the percentage of recipients

32:32
who respond to your email regardless of the nature of

32:35
the response. This helps you gauge your industry's overall activity

32:38
on emails

32:39
and message quality.

32:42
Then we've got positive reply rates, which is the percentage

32:45
of people who positively respond to your outreach. This again

32:49
for emails, if your goal is to close deals and

32:52
get clients, is going to act as your KPI for

32:55
an email outreach campaign.

32:57
And then we've got something unique, which is not necessarily

32:59
a part of LinkedIn or is part of Instagram. We've

33:01
got something called bounce rates. We're gonna be talking a

33:04
lot more about this in the cold email

33:07
module and the further we go, but I wanna introduce

33:09
the concept to you now because it is a metric

33:11
we need to track that will determine campaign success and

33:14
help us troubleshoot.

33:15
It is the percentage of emails

33:17
that could not be delivered

33:19
to the recipient.

33:21
This helps you identify issues with deliverability,

33:24
and your email list quality

33:27
will be covered a lot more in detail in the

33:30
call email module.

33:32
Then we've got Instagram

33:33
read rates, which is something that we haven't mentioned in

33:36
the other ones.

33:39
It's the percentage of recipients

33:41
who open and read your message.

33:44
This reveals whether your initial outreach captures attention and compels

33:48
further engagement or not. Meaning, if they reply, it did.

33:52
If they didn't reply, but they read the message, it

33:54
means there's a problem in the message. We're gonna do

33:56
a lot more troubleshooting in the second year. And then

33:58
we've got response rates, which is the same as the

34:00
other platforms that we've talked about, just how many people

34:03
reply regardless of the response. And then we've got, again,

34:06
positive reply rates, which is the same exact thing as

34:08
the other 2 platforms. This is your KPI if, again,

34:11
your business goals is to close clients.

34:14
And then the question becomes, when do we track these

34:17
metrics? How do we look at the KPIs?

34:19
When when do we even do this? Right?

34:22
And when it comes to outreach,

34:23
timing isn't just about when you send the messages. Timing

34:26
is also crucial

34:28
when you track your metrics, believe it or not. To

34:30
create effective outreach campaigns, you need a deep understanding

34:34
of how your efforts are performing

34:37
at different stages.

34:39
Developing this understanding

34:40
requires

34:41
consistent,

34:43
very important word, consistent

34:45
and timely tracking of your metrics.

34:48
As we talked about in the previous sections, metrics is

34:51
what we need to decode in order to understand how

34:54
our campaigns are doing.

34:55
And this

34:57
is the section where we talk about how timing is

35:00
important.

35:01
Because if we track

35:02
2 campaigns against each other and we draw conclusions from

35:06
1 metric or 1 campaign

35:08
in the first day, and the reason we're even talking

35:11
about this in the first place is because we need

35:12
to establish a consistent

35:15
behavior of tracking our campaigns

35:18
at the same time intervals.

35:19
Because if we track 1 campaign after it finishes

35:23
and 1 campaign

35:24
only if it's halfway through,

35:26
then we're obviously gonna get very different results and we're

35:28
gonna skew our problems. We're gonna come up with the

35:31
wrong conclusions based on those metrics.

35:34
Key tracking intervals is daily monitoring.

35:37
You wanna track the key metrics

35:39
and look for immediate issues.

35:42
On email, an example of this would be bounce rates.

35:44
If you get high bounce rates, that's an an immediate

35:46
issue. Again, we're gonna talk a lot more about that.

35:50
And then we've got weekly reviews, which is when you

35:52
should sit down and analyze trends and make a mid

35:55
campaign adjustment. So if there's anything you see that could

35:59
have been done better,

36:00
that should have been fixed, now is when to do

36:02
it once a week.

36:04
And then we've got what we call for the conclusion

36:07
window, which is 1 of the most important parts because

36:10
you're gonna build a database

36:12
of all your campaigns to understand what's working, what's not

36:15
working, what offers are good, what personalization

36:17
is working, all this kind of stuff.

36:19
And if you track 1 campaign the day after it

36:21
finishes and you track another campaign 4 months after it

36:25
finishes,

36:25
that campaign you waited 4 months to track might have

36:29
curated a lot of new replies that you didn't track

36:31
on the other campaign. So now the outreach metrics are

36:34
unfair. And if you start drawing conclusions

36:37
of different unfair metrics, you're gonna be all over the

36:41
place trying to make decisions

36:42
on skewed metrics, which is essentially never gonna help you.

36:46
So the conclusion window

36:47
is when you evaluate the overall campaign performance.

36:51
Now we're gonna run through all of these ones and

36:53
what you're tracking and the purpose for doing it. On

36:56
daily monitoring, we're gonna track deliverability,

36:58
open rates, bounce rates, and spam complaints.

37:02
This is across every platform,

37:03
and the purpose is to catch any media issues.

37:06
Weekly reviews, we're gonna look at reply rates, engagement trends,

37:10
and message effectiveness,

37:11
and the purpose is to identify patterns

37:14
and or make mid campaigns adjustment for the campaign to

37:17
perform better. And And then we've got the conclusion window.

37:20
The metrics we're gonna track is overall reply rates, conversion

37:23
rates,

37:24
and return on investment.

37:26
And the purpose of this is to evaluate the campaign

37:29
success

37:30
and inform future strategies. As I said, we want to

37:33
build up a database of campaigns we can look back

37:36
on, and we can say this offer did great against

37:38
this audience, and this other personalization did great against this

37:42
audience, meaning we should pair them together and make a

37:44
new campaign that's gonna perform really well. Right? This is

37:47
what we're gonna use to draw conclusions. This is a

37:49
very important thing. The sooner you start building it, the

37:51
better it is. A good rule of thumb is to

37:54
establish a consistent tracking schedule for your conclusion window, very

37:58
important,

37:59
and stick to it for all your campaigns.

38:02
We typically do 2 to 3 days after a campaign

38:05
finishes.

38:06
We will then always look at the campaign

38:08
2 days or 3 days after, and then we will

38:11
draw that metrics into a database that we can essentially

38:14
look back on and build out.

38:16
Understanding metrics. In the world of outreach, metrics

38:20
are your compass.

38:22
They guide your decision making,

38:24
highlighting areas for improvements.

38:26
It's very important

38:28
to understand what the different metrics are responsible

38:31
for.

38:32
Now we're gonna do a bit of a deep dive

38:33
into the different metrics, what they mean, and a glimpse

38:36
into what you can use them for.

38:38
Positive reply rates. First, a reply is any response received

38:42
from a recipient

38:44
regardless

38:45
of the intent.

38:46
A positive reply is a response indicating

38:49
interest or willingness to engage further.

38:52
This is the most important metric to focus on as

38:55
it directly correlates with the success of your outreach

38:59
in generating leads and opportunities

39:01
for your AAA business.

39:03
A low positive reply rate suggests that while your outreach

39:06
may be getting responses,

39:08
the content or offer

39:10
may need improvements.

39:12
Open rates. So first, a open is a recipient opening

39:16
what you sent them. And then an open rate is

39:18
the percentage of recipients

39:20
who view

39:21
the content

39:22
of a sent email or a sent message.

39:25
Alternate rates provides a bit of a glimpse into effectiveness

39:28
of your subject line, preview text, and deliverability.

39:32
We're gonna talk a lot more about this for email

39:35
specifically,

39:36
but nowadays in 20 24, open rates is not something

39:39
we're tracking for emails. This is gonna come in the

39:41
later modules where we're diving into emails and talking about

39:43
that a lot more. This is more bird's eye view

39:45
and broad on outreach in general.

39:48
And then we've got reply rates. Reply rates is the

39:52
percentage

39:53
of recipients

39:54
who respond to your email including all types of replies,

39:57
positive, negative, and automated.

39:59
This is also something we need to track. Right? And

40:01
the reply rates indicates an overall effectiveness

40:05
of your offer, call to action, and email content

40:08
or content of message rather

40:10
in prompting a response

40:12
from the recipients.

40:14
This is what it looks like when we're pulling all

40:15
of the metrics into a bit of an image and

40:17
we're talking about it. We've got a hundred people and

40:19
then we're getting 60 percent open it, 6 percent replied,

40:22
4 percent positive early replied, and 1 percent of them

40:25
has a book meeting.

40:28
Then lastly, we've got bounce rates, which is only particular

40:32
to email. This is not the case for LinkedIn. It's

40:34
not gonna be the case for Instagram or any other

40:35
platform, but I wanna introduce you to the concept because

40:38
it is a part of the metrics tracking.

40:40
Again, it's something we're gonna talk a lot more about

40:42
as we go into this specific module on email.

40:45
Bounce

40:46
is an email that failed to reach its intended recipient,

40:50
and a bounce rate is the percentage of emails

40:52
failing to reach the intended recipients.

40:55
Now this is very important.

40:57
High bounce rates are a massive, massive red flag in

41:01
email outreach.

41:02
They indicate you're sending to invalid slash non existent email

41:06
addresses

41:07
or have serious deliverability

41:10
issues.

41:11
We're going to dive a lot deeper into this in

41:12
the call email module, but I just want you to

41:14
understand what they're responsible for now. And the impact of

41:17
having high bounce rates is that will harm your email

41:20
reputation.

41:21
Email providers like Google and Outlook will view you as

41:24
a potential spammer if you have a lot of bounces.

41:27
They're gonna think, why is this person emailing so many

41:30
people that don't exist? And that's obviously suspicious.

41:33
And then it's gonna increase your spam folder placement because

41:37
of that. So future emails, even if you fix the

41:40
problem of bounces,

41:42
is going to land in spam.

41:44
We're gonna aim to maintain a bounce rate between 1

41:47
and 4 percent

41:49
to ensure optimal deliverability

41:51
and protect your sender reputation, which is what we call

41:54
it.

41:55
So make sure you're below 4 percent bounce rates in

41:58
any email campaigns.

42:00
Now we've got troubleshooting

42:02
based on all the metrics we've been talking about. So

42:05
this is how to apply the metrics we've been talking

42:07
about and learning about into troubleshooting and understanding what's going

42:10
wrong in your campaign.

42:12
When analyzing your outreach metrics, it's crucial to look at

42:15
the big picture to identify

42:17
which metrics

42:18
is actually the issue. By understanding

42:21
how different outreach metrics relate to each other,

42:25
you can pinpoint areas of improvement and prioritize

42:28
the optimization efforts.

42:31
Let's start off with low open rates. So if you've

42:34
got low open rates, you're gonna look into optimizing your

42:37
subject line,

42:38
improving your personalization

42:40
or preview text,

42:41
or addressing deliverability

42:43
issues. Secondly, we've got low reply rates. Before

42:47
tackling low reply rates,

42:49
we need to make sure that our open rates are

42:52
healthy.

42:53
Because if we think we have low reply rates,

42:56
but in reality, no 1 is opening our emails, we

42:59
think that we have low reply rates, meaning that's what

43:02
we try to fix. But in reality, we might have

43:04
a deliverability issue because no one's opened our email. So

43:07
these are putting the correct hierarchy. The first thing we

43:10
look for is the open rates, and then we unlock

43:12
to be able to look for low reply rates.

43:16
If you have low reply rates but you have a

43:18
high open rate or 60 percent plus open rate, then

43:20
you want to look at increasing overall relevance of your

43:24
message,

43:24
enhancing your personalization,

43:26
and refining your offer or clarifying

43:29
your call to action, your CTA.

43:31
You want to make it easy for people to reply.

43:34
If both of these are healthy,

43:36
meaning you got above 60 percent open rates and you've

43:39
got above

43:40
3 percent reply rates, then we're gonna go down and

43:42
we're gonna look at low positive reply rates. These 2

43:46
play together.

43:48
If you're getting replies but you're not getting enough positive

43:52
replies,

43:52
then we're gonna have to evaluate

43:55
the offer.

43:56
We're gonna have have to evaluate the tone and the

43:58
approach that we're taking in the message and the quality

44:01
of our lead list.

44:03
Even if people are not replying, does that mean that

44:05
they're not a fit? Did they slip through the crack

44:08
and they're essentially a bigger company, a smaller company, and

44:11
not a fit for our ACP? Or what's going on

44:12
with our lead list? So if you're low, positive reply

44:15
rates, consider these. Lastly, we've got high bounce rates. High

44:19
bounce rates, as we've talked about, can harm your email

44:22
reputation.

44:23
And to reduce them, we need to consider verifying

44:25
the quality of our email list

44:28
and addressing technical issues like spam filters, sending server problems,

44:32
etcetera.

44:33
This is all we're gonna talk about on this 1.

44:35
Just know that you need to troubleshoot

44:38
the high bounce rates by verifying emails and checking into

44:41
your setup.

44:42
This is something we're gonna cover so much more about

44:44
because it's so massively important for emails, so this is

44:47
all we're gonna keep it out on this section.

44:50
A bit of an example scenario to summarize and point

44:53
to action everything we've talked about today

44:55
is let's pretend you have a 1 percent reply rate

44:59
and a 5 percent open rate. At first glance, when

45:01
you're looking at this, you might think that the reply

45:05
rate seems like the main problem. However,

45:07
with such low open rate, it's likely that your emails

45:10
are actually landing in the spam folder.

45:13
In this case, focusing on improving your reply rates won't

45:16
actually make any difference at all until you fix the

45:20
deliverability

45:20
issue,

45:21
which is why it's so important

45:23
to use the framework

45:25
and this the hierarchy that we mapped out here to

45:28
make sure when you go through and troubleshoot

45:30
your campaigns.

45:32
In each of the outreach modules, you'll be given step

45:34
by step guides to analyze and optimize according to the

45:36
different platforms.

45:38
Optimization

45:39
and split testing is the next section.

45:41
AB testing,

45:43
also known as split testing, is a powerful method for

45:47
optimizing your outreach efforts.

45:49
By comparing

45:50
2 versions

45:51
of a variable or a outreach campaign, you can determine

45:55
which 1 performs better and iterates accordingly.

45:59
Optimization is a process of improving efficiency or effectiveness.

46:03
Iteration

46:04
is repeated cycles

46:06
of improvement or refinements,

46:08
and split testing is comparing 2 variants

46:11
to determine which 1 is better.

46:13
Now let's go into the key components that go into

46:15
the split testing. To create effective split test, you'll need

46:18
to understand the fundamental

46:20
elements involved.

46:22
So we've got a, which is what we call for

46:25
a control,

46:26
which is the original version that say serves as a

46:30
baseline for comparison.

46:32
And then we've got b that we call for a

46:35
variant,

46:36
which is the altered version of a

46:40
that it's being tested

46:41
against

46:42
the control.

46:44
So this means if you have an offer

46:47
that you know works because you've had good responses on

46:50
outreach before,

46:52
that would be a.

46:54
And then b

46:56
would be an offer that you think will perform better

46:59
than a. And the reason you put them into 1

47:01
campaign is so you can see the difference against the

47:04
control. Right? We make sure that the metrics are are

47:07
similar to what we expected on this. That means we

47:09
can draw conclusions that the variant was either better or

47:12
worse.

47:16
Here's how split testing works.

47:18
Split testing involves creating 2 versions of a specific element

47:23
in your outreach campaign, such as the subject line, an

47:26
offer, or a call to action. The original version serves

47:29
as the control,

47:31
while the modified version is the variant.

47:34
By sending each version to a portion of your target

47:38
audience

47:38
and measuring the results,

47:40
you can determine

47:42
which version performs better

47:44
based on your KPI,

47:47
which as again, just to repeat that in most cases,

47:49
it's going to be positive reply rates. Right? Here's a

47:51
bit of an example of us sending

47:53
an email campaign, in this case,

47:56
to 1000 people in total. We can see here variant

47:59
1 has 500 emails, and variant 2 has 500 emails.

48:03
It's very important that we send send the same amount

48:06
of emails so we can draw accurate conclusions on it.

48:09
As we can see variant 2 got more positive replies

48:12
than variant 1, which means variant 2 is a better

48:15
version.

48:17
So this could be an offer test where offer 1,

48:20
offer 2, and the new offer would come up with,

48:22
which is 2, is now better, and that's the 1

48:25
we want to go ahead and proceed with.

48:30
When it comes to what do we actually test and

48:32
what do we wanna focus on, do we test subject

48:34
lines? Do we test offers? What do we do? Here

48:37
it is. When it comes to optimizing our reach, there

48:39
are several key elements that you can split test. We've

48:42
got offer, which is essentially a compare offers to identify

48:46
which resonates

48:47
best with your audience.

48:48
For example,

48:50
different offer types

48:52
like consultation videos

48:54
against a free chatbot implementation.

48:57
And then we've got another component we could test which

48:59
is value proposition.

49:00
Experiment with different ways of articulating

49:03
your product or service's value.

49:06
Try highlighting unique features,

49:09
emphasizing specific benefits,

49:11
or focusing on different pin points your offer is addressing.

49:15
Just so I've said this I know this might be

49:17
a bit confusing, the offer versus a value proposition. This

49:20
is something we're gonna talk about very, very soon. It

49:22
comes in the next section. So if you struggle with

49:24
differentiating an offer and a value proposition,

49:27
hold on and bear with me for another 2 minutes.

49:32
Then we've got structure, content slash angle. These kind of

49:35
marry together because it's what we put under messaging.

49:38
It's test different approaches to structuring your message,

49:41
experiment with different content lengths,

49:43
storytelling techniques,

49:45
or framing strategies

49:46
that determine

49:48
what engages your audience most effectively.

49:51
This could mean make a campaign that's really, really short,

49:53
make 1 that's a bit longer with a lot more

49:55
information, see which 1 does better. Make 1 that's funny,

49:58
make 1 that's serious, see which 1 does better. Right?

50:01
And then we've got another component we can test, which

50:03
is call to action CTAs. Right? Split testing different CTAs

50:07
to identify

50:09
which drives the most action.

50:13
Compare the effectiveness

50:14
of a direct hard call to action

50:17
against the more subtle soft approaches,

50:20
which is something we're just about to jump into too.

50:22
So if hard versus cold is a bit confusing, that's

50:25
something we're gonna talk a lot about. But call to

50:27
action is another component.

50:28
And the last component

50:30
that's worth it looking into testing and iterating on is

50:33
personalization elements.

50:34
Experiment with various levels of types of personalization,

50:38
test different segmentation strategies,

50:40
dynamic content insertion techniques, and tailored recommendations

50:44
to enhance the relevant and engagement.

50:46
If these don't make sense to you just yet, segmentation

50:49
strategies and dynamic variables,

50:51
this is something we're gonna talk about in just a

50:53
second.

50:54
And then here's your priority list for what to test

50:56
first and a framework.

50:59
When deciding what to test first, considering the following priority

51:02
list. First, your offer, then your value proposition,

51:05
then your structure content slash angle, then your call to

51:08
action, and then personalization elements.

51:10
This is ranked

51:12
according to what will have the biggest impact on your

51:14
results first.

51:16
Start with testing the elements that are likely to have

51:18
the most significant impact on your outreach performance such as

51:21
the offer and value proposition.

51:23
Once you've optimized

51:24
and made these actual work, then you can move on

51:27
to testing more granular elements

51:29
like call to action,

51:31
personalization,

51:32
and things like subject lines.

51:34
Get more help when testing. Later in this module, you'll

51:37
be taken through

51:39
setting up your own outreach systems.

51:41
If you're struggling with knowing what to split test, book

51:45
in a call with an outreach coach. We are here

51:48
to help. This whole topic is something that can get

51:52
very confusing

51:53
and it's it's something a lot of elements have to

51:56
play into.

51:57
Like your audience, your segment,

51:59
what to test, when to test, why to test.

52:02
Test this against a different segment than the previous 1.

52:05
I know this can get confusing.

52:07
And if it gets confusing or if you need help

52:09
with this, us outreach cultures, we're here to help and

52:13
understand help you understand the context.

52:15
So bring your specific situation

52:17
to us on a call, and we'll help you not

52:20
only on what to do, but also how to look

52:22
at it and understanding it.

52:26
And then we've got, as I promised, offer versus value

52:29
proposition.

52:30
Understanding the difference between an offer and a value proposition

52:34
is crucial when split testing your outreach campaigns.

52:37
These 2 elements

52:39
form the foundation

52:40
of your message and can significantly

52:43
impact the results.

52:44
These alone are the 2 biggest result driving factors when

52:48
it comes to the components of a cold email.

52:51
Everything tying together, like, overall is probably the most important,

52:54
but as components individually speaking, these are 2 most important

52:59
things.

52:59
Offer is the immediate

53:01
opportunity

53:02
presented to a prospect,

53:04
I. E. Here is a cookie. Take it.

53:07
Value proposition

53:08
is the long term benefits or solutions

53:11
your product slash service provides.

53:15
Meaning, if this is here is a cookie, take it.

53:18
The value proposition of the cookie could be this cookie

53:21
will make you stronger.

53:23
Right? And we're gonna go through some example now in

53:25
a second.

53:26
Here's a couple of real world examples to put this

53:28
into perspective. Here's an example for an AI automation agency.

53:33
The offer is

53:34
free 30 minute consultation,

53:36
which is what we give them, what we offer them.

53:38
Right? And the value proposition

53:40
is

53:41
we help businesses not fall behind by explaining how AI

53:45
can help.

53:47
So the value proposition with them taking you up on

53:49
a 30 minute consultation

53:51
is that it will help the business understand how to

53:53
not fall behind by explaining how AI can help them.

53:58
And then we've got a plumber, where the offer is

54:01
a free plumbing inspection.

54:03
The value proposition I correlated with this offer is we

54:07
help homeowners

54:09
prevent costly water damage before they happen.

54:12
So the reason a homeowner or someone should take them

54:15
up on the free plumbing inspection

54:17
is to avoid having costly water damage by not knowing

54:21
what's going on. So they help prevent it. Right? That's

54:24
why they should take them up on the offer.

54:26
And then we've got a fitness coach where the offer

54:29
is a complimentary

54:30
4 to 5 minute personal training session.

54:33
The value prop, again, are correlated to this offer

54:37
is we'll show you the exact exercises

54:40
our clients have used to lose 20 kilograms

54:43
in 3 months depending on your situation.

54:46
I'm I'm sorry for all the, all the US people

54:49
out there that are talking in LBS.

54:51
I don't know. I'm European. Okay? I'm from Norway.

54:55
Anyways, you get the point. You still understand the point

54:57
of this. The reason they should take them up on

55:00
a complimentary

55:00
personal training session

55:02
is they will show you the exercises

55:05
other people have used to lose 20 kilograms in 3

55:07
months. Now we're getting into an exciting section, which is

55:10
effective messaging.

55:12
Crafting effective messaging is a critical

55:15
very critical component of successful outreach.

55:18
Your message

55:20
should be tailored to your target audience,

55:22
clearly communicating

55:24
your offer and value proposition,

55:26
as well as compelling them to take the desired

55:30
action.

55:32
This is a very, very important section.

55:34
In this section, we'll explore and go through offer, how

55:38
to craft compelling offers, value proposition,

55:41
communicating your unique benefits,

55:43
personalization,

55:45
tailor your message to each prospect

55:47
as well as on scale,

55:49
and call to actions, guiding prospects to the next step.

55:52
These are the 4 most important components to understand when

55:56
it comes to creating your message. If you get these

55:58
4 right, you can get a lot of other stuff

56:00
wrong.

56:02
Each of these elements are absolutely essential and work together

56:06
to craft an effective messaging.

56:08
It's important to carefully pay attention

56:11
to how they interact

56:12
as we move forward and go through this section.

56:16
We've already kind of explored how value proposition is a

56:19
byproduct of an offer,

56:20
the same way that personalization should tie into the offering

56:23
and the call to action needs to be relevant to

56:25
all those 3, which is why it's so important to

56:27
pay attention to this section. Because if your message is

56:30
not cohesive,

56:31
it's gonna have an impact on how many positive replies

56:33
you get.

56:35
The first thing I wanna talk about here is personalization.

56:38
Personalization

56:39
is tailoring your message to match each person's

56:42
unique interests and needs.

56:45
Personalization is the practice of tailoring your message to their

56:48
specific characteristics,

56:50
needs, or interests

56:52
of an individual

56:53
prospect.

56:54
It helps your message stand out and shows the recipient

56:58
that you've taken the time to understand their unique situation.

57:03
When it comes to presentation, I like to split this

57:06
up to 4 different buckets,

57:08
4 different levels. The first thing we have is basic

57:11
personalization,

57:12
which are things like using the prospect's name or very

57:15
basic information. An example of this is hi first name.

57:18
Notice you work at company name in industry.

57:21
All these variables displayed here, like first name, company name,

57:24
and industry are very basic variables.

57:27
And then we've got what I refer to as fake

57:30
personalization.

57:32
And this is using generic information that appears to be

57:35
personalized.

57:37
Most of the platforms that you're gonna be using to

57:39
send your outreach messages

57:41
are gonna have built in variables that you can actually

57:44
leverage to give a fake sense of personalization.

57:47
This is sometimes it's referred to as dynamic variables,

57:50
or the time is referred to as liquid spin tax.

57:53
There's a lot of different variations,

57:55
but what you need to understand is that they will

57:58
change

57:59
depending on things like leads time zone and current date

58:02
and time. And the cool things you can do with

58:04
fake personalization

58:06
are things like good morning,

58:09
hope you're having a good start to the week.

58:12
And the idea with this is that these would automatically

58:15
change

58:17
depending on the current time

58:19
for the lead in this case and the current day

58:21
of the week for the lead.

58:23
This specific variable, just to give you guys a little

58:26
tiny bit of context,

58:27
is this variable

58:29
when it's Monday

58:30
through Wednesday, it will say hope you're having a good

58:33
start to the week. And Wednesday through Friday, it will

58:36
say hope your week has been good.

58:39
Right? And the idea of this is to create just

58:41
a little sense

58:43
of personalization that is not personal to them but it

58:45
makes it seem like the the message was only written

58:48
for them because things like time is a factor here.

58:52
And then we've got segmented personalization

58:54
which is tailoring your message based on specific segments.

58:58
So an example of this is saw your company truck

59:02
drive by downtown earlier this week.

59:05
If you're

59:06
segmenting

59:08
by location, let's say a specific city, and you live

59:11
in that city and the industry is an industry that

59:14
have company marked trucks,

59:16
you can do a a personalization that says, saw your

59:19
truck die drive by downtime earlier last week,

59:22
earlier this week. And that gives a sense of segmented

59:26
personalization. Segmented personalization is something you can apply that would

59:29
be relevant for every single person in that list. So

59:32
it's not necessarily personal to the 1 person, but it's

59:35
personalization because you could only say it to the segment

59:38
of the list that you have.

59:40
And then we've got the most exciting things for all

59:43
of us in the AI space, which is obviously

59:45
hyper personalization with AI,

59:47
which is leveraging AI for highly personalized messages.

59:51
An example

59:52
of this could be loved your recent post

59:56
on marketing.

59:57
Loved your recent post on call email deliverability.

01:00:00
Loved your recent post on

01:00:02
getting a 6 pack quick. Right? And the idea with

01:00:05
this is that you would get your hands on the

01:00:06
post and you would essentially

01:00:09
have AI draw a conclusion from the post that you

01:00:12
could refer to and you can automatically do this for

01:00:15
10 to tens of thousands of leads. And we're gonna

01:00:18
be talking a lot more about this in the later

01:00:19
modules, but I just need you to have an understanding

01:00:22
of what the different ones are and how they kinda

01:00:24
work together.

01:00:25
Because this is, again, the section on message

01:00:28
cohesiveness.

01:00:30
The next section we're gonna be talking about is number

01:00:33
2, the offer.

01:00:35
A desired offer is absolutely crucial component

01:00:39
of your outreach message.

01:00:41
It should be compelling,

01:00:44
relevant,

01:00:45
and not to mention easy to understand,

01:00:48
enticing the prospects to take the next step in engaging

01:00:52
with your agency. There's a couple of key aspects

01:00:55
to creating an effective offer.

01:00:57
This is what you need to consider.

01:00:59
Clarity,

01:01:00
make it easy to understand what they're actually getting

01:01:05
immediate value. Provide something that they can get the value

01:01:08
from right away.

01:01:10
Low commitment,

01:01:12
make it easy for the prospects to say yes.

01:01:16
And relevance,

01:01:17
tailor it to prospects

01:01:19
likely needs or interests.

01:01:24
If you reach out to someone

01:01:26
with something they don't need

01:01:28
or don't have an interest in,

01:01:30
people are simply not going to reply to you.

01:01:34
Here's a couple of examples when it comes to offers

01:01:36
for your outage. It could be a free consultation,

01:01:40
which you offer expert advice on their specific situation. It

01:01:44
could be a demo or a trial,

01:01:46
offers a hands on experience with your product or your

01:01:49
service.

01:01:50
It could be solution ideation,

01:01:53
which presents a tailored solution concept

01:01:56
for their business.

01:01:58
It could be a personalized

01:02:00
analysis,

01:02:01
which is providing

01:02:03
a custom report or audit

01:02:05
at their current state,

01:02:07
or it could be something like exclusive content,

01:02:10
like industry insights or research not available publicly that you

01:02:14
could share with them relevant to your end offering. What

01:02:17
we're talking about here is our offer does not have

01:02:20
to be our service offering. This is a very common

01:02:23
misconception,

01:02:24
in the AI industry and pretty much every industry

01:02:27
is people think they need to offer their services in

01:02:30
an outreach message, which

01:02:31
is very wrong. You just need to offer people something

01:02:34
that is relative to your services like we've talked about

01:02:37
here. Right? Free consultation, demo trial, not your actual service.

01:02:41
Services don't sell over outreach

01:02:44
simply.

01:02:45
The closest you will get to it is selling the

01:02:47
meeting, not the service. So if you do not want

01:02:50
to take the approach of giving free value, which I

01:02:53
absolutely advise that everyone should be doing,

01:02:57
then the closest thing you will get is selling the

01:03:00
meeting and not the service.

01:03:02
Meaning, in outreach, your goal is to get a meeting,

01:03:06
not a sale.

01:03:09
Think of it as the first step in a much

01:03:11
longer journey.

01:03:13
Here's why it works: it's a lot lower pressure meaning

01:03:17
prospects are likely to say yes to chat rather than

01:03:20
to purchase.

01:03:21
If you force someone to make a buying decision

01:03:24
of the very little information you can give in an

01:03:26
outreach message, I can guarantee you that they're not gonna

01:03:29
have enough intel or information

01:03:31
to actually pay for your services.

01:03:34
It builds trust. So meetings let you connect and understand

01:03:38
their needs better

01:03:40
as well as you can tailor your pitch. So learn

01:03:42
about their specific challenges before actually proposing their solutions. Learn

01:03:46
about the problems, learn about what they're facing, and then

01:03:48
you can give them a solution that is actually relevant

01:03:51
and valuable to them. Let me ask you, which 1

01:03:54
of these 2 sound better?

01:03:56
I'll set up an AI system for your business,

01:03:59
or

01:03:59
let's have a 15 minute chat to explore how AI

01:04:03
could help your business.

01:04:05
Which 1 do you think

01:04:06
sounds better?

01:04:08
Definitely

01:04:09
number 2. Right? Because here you're asking for them to

01:04:12
essentially

01:04:13
what what are you even asking for? There's not enough

01:04:15
context. You're not giving the prospect enough context on like,

01:04:17
what am I saying yes to? What am I saying

01:04:19
no to? Am I paying for some like, what's even

01:04:21
going on? While in this 1, you're saying let's have

01:04:24
a 15 minute

01:04:25
call just to explore if AI could even help you

01:04:28
in the first place. It's a very more

01:04:30
open approach which a lot more prospects will say yes

01:04:34
to.

01:04:34
So option number 2 is definitely superior,

01:04:37
in this case.

01:04:39
And then number 3 is a value proposition.

01:04:42
We've already talked about what a value proposition is.

01:04:46
Now let's dive into how to make a good 1.

01:04:48
The key elements of a strong value proposition

01:04:52
is specificity

01:04:54
clearly state what unique value you provide that is relative

01:04:58
to the audience or the specific segment that you're actually

01:05:01
reaching out to. The more specific you are, the better

01:05:03
it will perform.

01:05:06
Number 2 is problem solving. It has to address a

01:05:09
specific pain point or challenge.

01:05:12
If you have a value proposition that helps with something

01:05:14
people don't care about, well, there's no value. Right? It's

01:05:18
just a proposition at that point. Right?

01:05:20
And then we've got quantification.

01:05:23
Where possible,

01:05:24
include measurable benefits.

01:05:26
When you're reaching out to someone,

01:05:29
you need to help their brain put into perspective how

01:05:32
much you can benefit them. And you're saying, oh, I

01:05:34
can save time.

01:05:36
Isn't as impactful as saying,

01:05:38
we save 20 hours a week on average. Do you

01:05:41
wanna see if we can do the same for you?

01:05:44
We help companies in the in the trucking industry save

01:05:46
30 hours a week by automating their backlog

01:05:50
of inventory.

01:05:52
Would you wanna see if we can do the same

01:05:53
for you? That's specific and it's a problem they have.

01:05:56
Right?

01:05:57
If we remove those 2 components, then our value proposition

01:06:00
is no longer valuable.

01:06:02
It is useless.

01:06:03
So this is very important.

01:06:06
And then

01:06:07
as I said on this part,

01:06:10
if you can do it, if you don't have any

01:06:12
metrics you can draw for any previous clients you can

01:06:14
draw off or any conclusions or

01:06:16
or research papers you can look into, that's fine. I'll

01:06:19
give you guys a bit of a hack on this

01:06:21
1, and it is you don't need to refer to

01:06:23
your own services when you're reaching out to people.

01:06:26
Let's pretend you're reaching out in real estate because that's

01:06:28
a couple of the previous example we've done is in

01:06:30
real estate. And I wanna tell you guys that when

01:06:32
I first started my AI company and I was reaching

01:06:34
out to real estate, I didn't have metrics or measurable

01:06:37
benefits of my services. But what I did is because

01:06:40
real estate is such a public industry, I went online

01:06:42
and I googled

01:06:43
real estate agents who use AI, and I used their

01:06:46
case study to my advantage.

01:06:48
So I would reach out to people and I say,

01:06:50
did you see how John

01:06:52
luxury real estate agent in their city to make it

01:06:54
relevant. Right? So did you see how essentially your competitor

01:06:58
was able to double the clients they took on by

01:07:00
implementing AI to take care of the paperwork?

01:07:03
I never said I did it because I didn't provide

01:07:05
the service. I just said he used AI to do

01:07:08
it and I can explain how. And then the value

01:07:10
proposition would be that I'll explain to you

01:07:13
how John did it

01:07:15
if you want.

01:07:17
And that's the value proposition. And now you're including measurable

01:07:20
quantifiable results that they can draw conclusions on. They're like,

01:07:23
what? Bob took on another 50 clients? I wanna do

01:07:26
that. I didn't know that was possible.

01:07:28
It's very different from just saying I can help you

01:07:30
take on more clients because then they make up their

01:07:33
own numbers, which is never good.

01:07:36
Right? And then differentiation.

01:07:39
Highlight what sets you apart from your competitors.

01:07:42
AI isn't necessarily a thing that is super competitive at

01:07:45
the moment.

01:07:46
Everyone has people reaching out to them about different services,

01:07:48
different things. So highlight what sets you apart. What's your

01:07:51
unique selling point? That's something you definitely want to include

01:07:54
in the value proposition if you can.

01:07:57
And then crafting your value proposition for Outreach,

01:08:00
you need to focus on the outcomes,

01:08:02
emphasize the end results, not the features,

01:08:05
align with your prospect needs, so tailor it to what

01:08:08
you know about their challenges,

01:08:10
keep it concise, communicate the value quickly and clearly,

01:08:15
and make it believable.

01:08:16
So avoid exaggeration

01:08:18
and be prepared to back up your claims. If you

01:08:20
say you can save 50 hours a week,

01:08:23
you definitely wanna be able to save some hours at

01:08:25
least.

01:08:26
And here again, let's do another 1 of these example.

01:08:28
Which sounds better?

01:08:30
Our AI platform uses cutting edge technology to automate processes

01:08:34
and improve efficiency.

01:08:37
Or option 2, which is in just 30 days, our

01:08:41
AI platform can reduce your operational cost by 20 percent

01:08:44
by automating the repetitive tasks.

01:08:47
Option 2 definitely sounds a lot better in my books.

01:08:50
That's what I kinda wanna get across here to you

01:08:52
guys is that this 1 is unspecific and just a

01:08:54
vague value proposition, while this 1 is specific referring to

01:08:58
in 30 days, our platform usually reduces operation cost by

01:09:01
20 percent

01:09:03
by automating x, y, and z or by doing x,

01:09:05
y, and z. Now we're so specific that we're getting

01:09:08
believable and it makes sense. It's logic. Right? And they

01:09:11
actually understand what we're trying to get across.

01:09:15
And then we've got call to actions, which is number

01:09:18
4. Call to action is a clear and specific instruction

01:09:21
that guides the recipient on what action to take such

01:09:25
as scheduling a call or requesting more information.

01:09:28
Your CTA is responsible for the prospect

01:09:31
taking the appropriate action

01:09:34
after reading and being interested in what you sent them.

01:09:38
There's a couple of key elements to an effective call

01:09:40
to action.

01:09:42
It is clear and specific.

01:09:44
It is low commitment.

01:09:47
It is relevant to the overall message, and it is

01:09:50
actionable and easy to follow.

01:09:52
If you tell them,

01:09:54
to get my offer, you need to walk from Sweden

01:09:56
to Norway. No one's gonna take you up on our

01:09:59
offer. However, if you just say to take me off

01:10:01
on our open my offer,

01:10:03
let me know, reply to my email.

01:10:05
That's, like, easy. Y e s enter. Done. Right? Easy.

01:10:10
So if you follow all 4 of these, you're definitely

01:10:12
gonna be on the right path to have a very

01:10:14
effective and clear call to action.

01:10:17
Now there is a couple of different types of call

01:10:19
to actions, believe it or not. There are 2 main

01:10:22
types of call to actions you can use in our

01:10:23
outreach message, soft and hard call to actions.

01:10:26
It's crucial to understand the difference

01:10:29
so you know what you have to choose from.

01:10:32
Soft's call to action is a low pressure ask that

01:10:36
requires very little effort from the prospect side. Example is,

01:10:40
mind if I send more information? Can I send a

01:10:42
quick video explaining how we help similar company?

01:10:45
Would you be open to hearing more about our solution?

01:10:48
Like, can I send you more information? Right?

01:10:50
And then a hard call to action or opposite side

01:10:53
is a high pressure ask that requires much more effort

01:10:56
from the prospect side. Example of this is, are you

01:10:59
free for a quick call this week to discuss this

01:11:02
further? I'd love to walk you through the solution in

01:11:04
more detail. What's a good time to connect?

01:11:07
If you're interested, let's schedule a call to explore how

01:11:09
this can help you. These are all call to actions

01:11:12
that require a lot of effort from the prospect, not

01:11:15
because they have to reply, but because they have to

01:11:17
show up to a meeting for them to get the

01:11:19
value. Right?

01:11:21
When you're starting out, if you're

01:11:23
unsure about which 1 to pick, simply stick with a

01:11:26
soft call to action. And if you get too many

01:11:28
replies to handle, you simply change it to a hard

01:11:31
call to action. If you have the time on your

01:11:33
hands, I will definitely advise to start with a soft

01:11:35
call to action.

01:11:37
When it comes to choosing the right 1, other than

01:11:39
what I just said,

01:11:41
it is very important to consider the following factors.

01:11:44
Relationship.

01:11:46
If you've already established a relationship with a prospect, a

01:11:49
hard call to action may be appropriate.

01:11:51
If you're reaching out to a cold lead

01:11:54
or prospect, a soft call to action is usually the

01:11:57
better choice.

01:11:58
The next 1 is interest level. If the prospect has

01:12:01
shown strong interest in your offering,

01:12:03
a hard call to action can help move the conversation

01:12:06
forward.

01:12:07
If you're unsure about their interest, again, a soft call

01:12:10
to action can help gauge their receptiveness.

01:12:14
Last 1 here is offer.

01:12:16
If your offer is complex and required a more detailed

01:12:20
explanation,

01:12:21
a harder call to action for a meeting

01:12:23
may be necessary.

01:12:25
If your offer is straightforward

01:12:27
and simple to understand,

01:12:29
a call to action

01:12:31
to send more information can suffice.

01:12:34
Remember,

01:12:35
the goal with the call to action is make it

01:12:37
easy for the prospect to take the next step in

01:12:39
engaging with your agency.

01:12:41
By choosing the right call to action for each situation,

01:12:45
you'll increase the likelihood of getting a positive response and

01:12:48
moving the relationship forward.

01:12:50
Also, when you get a positive response,

01:12:52
that is not a hard ask, you're gonna get a

01:12:55
lot more, which helps you essentially filter out the people

01:12:58
that might be semi interested so so you can follow-up

01:13:00
with them on the other channels and nurture them into

01:13:03
the sale. Now we've gone down to the copywriting section.

01:13:06
Effective copywriting is essential for crafting compelling outreach messages that

01:13:10
grab your prospects' attention

01:13:12
and persuade them to take action.

01:13:16
While strategies may vary depending on the audience, platform, and

01:13:19
industry, there are still some main foundational principle

01:13:23
that apply across the board.

01:13:26
So what really is copywriting?

01:13:29
At its core, copywriting is words that sell.

01:13:33
It's a strategic use of language

01:13:36
to promote ideas, products, or services

01:13:39
that drive audience engagement. Right?

01:13:42
Objectives when it comes to copywriting

01:13:45
could be attract attention, generate interest, create desire, or prompt

01:13:49
action.

01:13:50
The value of copywriting goes far beyond just sending a

01:13:53
message.

01:13:54
Copywriting is a highly valuable skill in the digital age.

01:13:58
It's the foundation

01:14:00
of effective marketing

01:14:02
from crafting compelling emails to writing persuasive landing pages. As

01:14:07
you delve deeper, you'll discover it's like an iceberg.

01:14:10
There's

01:14:11
always more to learn beneath the surface.

01:14:14
Mastering copywriting is a lifelong journey, but even the basic

01:14:18
skills can significantly impact your business success

01:14:22
overall

01:14:23
not just in terms of outreach.

01:14:26
There's a couple of key principles that play into copywriting.

01:14:31
It's personalization,

01:14:32
making the message feel like it's written for an individual

01:14:34
and not mass audience by using their names, mention specific

01:14:37
details like we've talked about previously.

01:14:39
Then there is simplicity.

01:14:41
Using fifth grader reading level

01:14:44
to ensure clarity and accessibility,

01:14:47
which essentially just means avoid complex jargon

01:14:50
or convoluted sentences

01:14:52
that may confuse or overwhelm the reader.

01:14:56
Industry specific language is another important part of a copywriting,

01:14:59
incorporating relevant terminology and concepts that demonstrates your credibility and

01:15:04
understanding of the prospect's industry.

01:15:07
However, be cautious to not overuse

01:15:10
sales specific buzzwords

01:15:12
that may come across

01:15:14
as inauthentic

01:15:15
or pushy.

01:15:17
Next point is brevity.

01:15:19
Keep your message concise and to the point. Respect your

01:15:23
prospects time by focusing on the most important information

01:15:26
and avoid any unnecessary fluff or tangents.

01:15:31
Next point is relevance.

01:15:33
Ensure that the content of your message is pertinent to

01:15:36
the recipients

01:15:37
and their specific

01:15:38
situation or needs. Highlight how your offering can solve their

01:15:42
challenges or help achieve their goals.

01:15:44
If your message is not relevant to the prospect, no

01:15:47
1 will ever reply. This does not apply to just

01:15:50
offer. This does not apply to just personalization.

01:15:52
Cohesively, the whole message needs to be relevant.

01:15:56
Specificity.

01:15:57
Use concrete details, examples, or data points to support your

01:16:01
claims and make your message more compelling.

01:16:04
Vague generalities

01:16:06
are less likely to resonate with your prospects or inspire

01:16:09
them to take the action you want them to take.

01:16:12
Next point and key principle

01:16:14
is authenticity.

01:16:16
Write in a conversational

01:16:19
human

01:16:20
tone.

01:16:21
I will repeat this, right in a conversational

01:16:26
human

01:16:27
tone.

01:16:28
This should be tattooed on everyone's forehead when they're writing

01:16:31
emails or writing outreach messages.

01:16:33
This is over 1000 coaching calls. If I were to

01:16:37
put 1 thing that everyone misses out on in the

01:16:40
start of creating their outreach

01:16:43
is they don't write in a conversational human tone. It's

01:16:46
like they're writing a marketing message.

01:16:49
And what I always say around this is that if

01:16:52
you read through your outreach message

01:16:54
and you think you could put it on a Facebook

01:16:56
ad or a Google ad or a YouTube ad and

01:16:58
it would perform well,

01:17:00
then it's a bad outreach message.

01:17:03
Outreach message, it's not mass marketing. Outreach message is not

01:17:07
mass, it's a 1 on 1 communication channel. Right?

01:17:10
So you need to write in a way where you're

01:17:12
writing it almost to a friend or 1 person.

01:17:15
A trick for getting,

01:17:17
authenticity into your message is write a message

01:17:21
for your best friend or a family member

01:17:24
about the value proposition and the offer you want to

01:17:26
bring to these businesses.

01:17:28
And then you look at the document and you figure

01:17:31
out how can I change this to apply to the

01:17:33
business instead of my best friend or my family member?

01:17:36
You really wanna avoid any overly formal or robotic language

01:17:40
that may come as cross as insincere or generic.

01:17:45
Very, very important.

01:17:48
Lastly, we've got readability.

01:17:50
Structure your message for maximum impact and easy scanning.

01:17:54
Use short sentences that flow naturally into each other.

01:17:59
Break up text into small digestible paragraphs,

01:18:02
often just 1 or 2 sentences each.

01:18:05
Avoid any large blocks of text that can overwhelm

01:18:09
the readers.

01:18:11
Incorporate white space to strategically

01:18:14
guide the eye and make your

01:18:16
message inviting to read

01:18:19
even on mobile devices.

01:18:21
This is another 1 of those things that over a

01:18:23
thousand coaching calls I've seen happen a lot of the

01:18:26
time is people write their outreach message on a computer

01:18:29
and don't consider where their prospects are actually gonna read

01:18:32
the message.

01:18:33
If you always

01:18:35
write a message that works on a phone, it will

01:18:37
also work on a laptop. If you write on a

01:18:40
laptop, it's not gonna work on a phone. So need

01:18:42
to make sure that it's

01:18:44
easy to read on a mobile device.

01:18:48
Now we've gotten down to the golden question.

01:18:52
As you craft your copy,

01:18:54
consistently

01:18:55
ask yourself

01:18:56
what's in it for them?

01:18:59
This

01:19:00
should be put on a post it note

01:19:02
on your monitor.

01:19:04
Every sentence should provide value,

01:19:07
address a need, or highlight a benefit for the prospect.

01:19:12
Keep their perspective

01:19:13
and interests at the forefront.

01:19:16
I'm gonna give you guys a bit of reality check,

01:19:18
and it is that prospects simply

01:19:21
don't care about you.

01:19:23
You are reaching out to them. You are putting yourself

01:19:25
in their inbox,

01:19:27
and prospects

01:19:28
could not care less

01:19:30
about who you are, where you're from unless it's relevant

01:19:33
to them. So everything you're writing about a message, you

01:19:37
need to ask yourself the golden question,

01:19:39
what's in it for them?

01:19:42
My company name is at my company, we do there's

01:19:46
nothing in them for them to have that sentence in

01:19:48
there. That's an example I see very frequent on coaching

01:19:51
calls. Is this sentence that says,

01:19:54
at my company

01:19:55
or at x y z a I, we do.

01:19:58
There is no value in it for them

01:20:01
to know that company name unless you're world renowned. Take

01:20:03
away the company name and focus on what actually matters

01:20:06
to the prospects, what is in it for them. Very,

01:20:09
very important.

01:20:10
And then here's a couple of recommended books because as

01:20:13
we've talked about, copywriting is like an iceberg. It's a

01:20:15
lifelong learning curve.

01:20:18
And copywriting, like anything else, improves with practice and iteration.

01:20:22
The more you write, refine, and test your outreach messages,

01:20:26
the better you'll become at crafting effective compelling copy.

01:20:30
To further advance your copywriting skills, consider some of these

01:20:33
books.

01:20:34
Here I've got a couple of books listed. You guys

01:20:36
can Google them, look them up. The awesome authors are

01:20:39
here.

01:20:39
See if there's anything you find interest in. This, as

01:20:42
we've talked about, is 1 of those skills that you'll

01:20:45
always have a need for regardless of if you're doing

01:20:47
outreach or not.

01:20:49
Now we're getting into the more exciting part because now

01:20:51
we talked about the theory about outreach, copywriting, all that

01:20:53
kind of stuff. So now let's try putting it a

01:20:55
bit into use.

01:20:58
This is a copywriting example

01:21:00
and a framework that can be tweaked according to the

01:21:03
industry

01:21:05
and used to achieve good results

01:21:07
across industries.

01:21:09
How well it performs is limited to how you change

01:21:13
it.

01:21:15
If you try copy pasting it, you will fail

01:21:18
miserably.

01:21:21
That is a show that you're not willing to put

01:21:24
in the work of understanding

01:21:26
and putting these things into action. If you just copy

01:21:26
paste this, nothing's gonna work. Nothing you copy paste from

01:21:28
online is going to work the way you want it

01:21:30
to.

01:21:31
So you need to understand the framework I'm about to

01:21:33
explain and apply your own strategies to it

01:21:40
depending on the foundation we've talked about earlier which is

01:21:43
the research. Right?

01:21:45
This is called the 4 t's framework and it's from

01:21:48
Josh Brown.

01:21:51
Developed by Salesforce for Josh Brown, the 4 t framework

01:21:54
is a powerful approach to crafting effective outreach messages.

01:21:59
This framework consists of 4 key components

01:22:02
that work together

01:22:04
to capture the prospect's attention,

01:22:06
create interest, and encourage a response.

01:22:10
Capturing the prospect's attention, creating interest, and encouraging a response

01:22:14
are words and concepts you should be familiar with now

01:22:16
as you've listened and taken notes throughout this module.

01:22:19
And this is what the framework does. The ingredients of

01:22:22
this framework is a trigger,

01:22:25
which is an observation that relates to a potential problem,

01:22:29
what we call for think, which is a question that

01:22:32
makes people think differently about their current solution,

01:22:35
third party credibility,

01:22:37
what similar people are doing to reduce the risk,

01:22:40
And lastly, we've got talk, which is gauging interest. It's

01:22:44
more like

01:22:45
a either way

01:22:46
subconsciously

01:22:47
says

01:22:48
there's no pressure here, which as you can see, either

01:22:50
way rock that run is what we use. I'm gonna

01:22:52
go through and I'm gonna explain it. They're color coded

01:22:54
as well to help you understand what is the trigger,

01:22:55
what is the think, what is third party credibility, and

01:22:58
what is the talk.

01:22:59
Josh,

01:23:00
looks like you're training for your first marathon in Miami.

01:23:03
This is personalization, what we talked about earlier. Right? AI

01:23:06
personalization.

01:23:08
How are you reducing the risk of plantar fasciitis

01:23:12
and hammer toe caused by narrow toe box?

01:23:15
Cramped shoes hinder the natural movement of your toes.

01:23:20
Over 2000 runners use our wide toe box shoe, which

01:23:23
allows toes to splay naturally

01:23:26
preventing injury.

01:23:28
Worth a look?

01:23:29
Either way, rock that run, James.

01:23:32
As you can see, this is a great example that

01:23:35
displays

01:23:36
a lot of the things we've been talking about

01:23:38
throughout the module.

01:23:41
This is a framework that you can take and apply

01:23:45
to your specific scenario

01:23:47
using the 4 different ingredients here by changing it to

01:23:50
what is relevant for your industry. If you're struggling on

01:23:53
where to get started and what frameworks to use because

01:23:55
there's a lot out there, I would highly suggest starting

01:23:58
off with this framework as it gives you a very

01:24:00
solid foundation.

01:24:01
That being said,

01:24:03
frameworks is as well something like everything else in outreach

01:24:06
that we need to experiment and test. Depending on our

01:24:09
industry, they might resonate with something else. But this is

01:24:12
a great way to kinda get your foot in the

01:24:13
door and start testing the word with outreach, and then

01:24:15
you can start exploring your own frameworks or other online

01:24:18
frameworks as you go.

01:24:20
Now we've gone down to the follow-up section.

01:24:24
When performing outreach to our prospects,

01:24:26
we don't just give up at the first try.

01:24:30
Just because they didn't respond immediately

01:24:33
doesn't mean they are not interested.

01:24:36
Often, they are busy entrepreneurs

01:24:38
and mean to reply to you, but you haven't called

01:24:41
them at the right time.

01:24:43
Follow-up

01:24:44
is a subsequent

01:24:46
message

01:24:47
sent after your initial outreach to reengage the prospect. A

01:24:51
follow-up sequence is a series of planned strategic follow-up messages.

01:24:57
And TAM is something we're gonna be referring to here

01:25:00
is total addressable market, which basically means the total market

01:25:04
demand for your product or service. Meaning, how many people

01:25:07
could you essentially sell your product to? Why follow ups

01:25:10
are a absolute nonnegotiable?

01:25:13
In outreach, persistence isn't just a virtue. It's an absolute

01:25:17
necessity, and here's why. Number 1 is busy prospects.

01:25:21
Your contacts are often swamped entrepreneurs

01:25:25
who intend to reply but haven't find the right moment.

01:25:30
Number 2 is multiple touch points. Research shows that it

01:25:33
takes an average of 8 touch points to get a

01:25:35
meeting with a new prospect.

01:25:38
Number 3 is timing is everything. Your first message might

01:25:42
not catch them at the right time, but your third

01:25:44
or seventh

01:25:46
might.

01:25:47
Now there's a couple of guidelines that we absolutely need

01:25:49
to take into consideration and follow here. Right?

01:25:52
And the amount and the frequency of your follow ups

01:25:55
is very often something people ask about, and it should

01:25:58
always be dependent

01:26:00
on your research

01:26:01
on the audience.

01:26:03
So how often they check their emails will be responsible

01:26:07
for the frequency between follow ups and how big your

01:26:11
TAM, as we talked about total addressable market,

01:26:14
how your how big your TAM is will determine how

01:26:17
many follow ups you need to send in order to

01:26:20
not run out of prospects

01:26:22
in 6 months.

01:26:24
Even if you wouldn't run out of your total addressable

01:26:27
market, if you were to send 1 message,

01:26:29
general guidelines should be at least sending 2 to 3.

01:26:33
To shine a bit more clarity on when we're talking

01:26:35
about total addressable market and the frequency and how many

01:26:38
follow ups and stuff like that is

01:26:39
how many follow ups you send should always be mainly

01:26:42
dependent on your industry. Right? So how busy are they?

01:26:44
How many does the average

01:26:47
business have to send to contact this industry? And when

01:26:49
do they actually reply? I'll give you some general guidelines

01:26:52
on what you can do in cold and warm afterwards,

01:26:54
but I wanna help you understand that in our reach,

01:26:57
1 of the things we're actually looking for is that

01:27:00
after 6 months of initially reaching out to prospects, we

01:27:03
can follow back up with the prospects because so much

01:27:06
things in business change in a 6 months time frame.

01:27:09
Meaning, if your total addressable market is 200 people,

01:27:13
you can reach out to every single 1 of them,

01:27:15
and in 6 months from now, you can reach back

01:27:18
out to them again.

01:27:20
So when we're talking about how many follow ups you

01:27:22
should send,

01:27:23
you need to consider how large your total addressable market

01:27:26
is. Because if you decide to send 1 follow-up,

01:27:29
that might mean that you've run out of your total

01:27:32
adjustable markets

01:27:34
before that 6 month times period time span is up,

01:27:37
which is a problem because now you got no 1

01:27:39
to reach out to. And you have your hands behind

01:27:41
your back and you don't know what to do, your

01:27:43
hands in your pockets, just doesn't work.

01:27:45
So make sure that if you decide to follow-up 2

01:27:48
times with prospects or 3 times with prospects,

01:27:51
make sure that if you do that with a volume

01:27:54
you're planning on sending, will you run out or will

01:27:57
you not run out in 6 months?

01:27:59
And what I'm explaining that even if you have a

01:28:01
large enough time to send 1 message

01:28:04
and you still would never run out of prospects,

01:28:07
you still shouldn't only send 1. You should always follow-up

01:28:09
at least 1 or 2 times, meaning 2 or 3

01:28:12
messages in total. So even if your total adjustable market

01:28:15
is the whole world,

01:28:17
you sell money. You give away money, meaning your total

01:28:20
adjustable market is literally the whole world. Right?

01:28:23
In theory, you can send 1 message per person,

01:28:26
which is okay.

01:28:27
But when we're calculating in the cost of leads, the

01:28:29
cost of acquiring, personalization, all that kind of stuff, it

01:28:32
doesn't make sense to give up after 1, which is

01:28:34
why we should always send 2 to 3 per person

01:28:37
in total.

01:28:38
And here's a couple of guidelines

01:28:41
and the general industry standards when it comes to call

01:28:44
email follow ups. Amount is usually 2 to 3 follow

01:28:47
ups. Spacing

01:28:49
is 2 to 5 days apart depending on how frequent

01:28:52
the industry checks their emails. And the goal is not

01:28:55
to exhaust your time too quickly,

01:28:58
meaning 6 months. Right?

01:29:00
And then with warm follow ups, this is after someone

01:29:03
shows interest, after you've connected with someone, after you've engaged

01:29:07
or talked with someone or someone you know from before,

01:29:09
then this switches. Because these guys are a lot more

01:29:12
valuable than just a random cold lead that might not

01:29:14
even have access to their emails if that's where you're

01:29:17
contacting them. Right?

01:29:18
The amount of emails you should attend with a warm

01:29:21
prospect

01:29:22
is unlimited.

01:29:25
You should continue

01:29:26
until you get a definite

01:29:29
response.

01:29:31
And in the start, you wanna be more frequent

01:29:34
than you are with the cold follow ups. You wanna

01:29:36
do something along the lines of 2 to 3 days

01:29:39
is definitely acceptable.

01:29:41
However, the longer you go without a reply,

01:29:44
the longer you want to have as a time frame

01:29:46
between your emails. So this might look like you send

01:29:50
1 message and then they don't reply 2 days after

01:29:53
you send another 1, 2 days after you send another

01:29:55
1, 3 days after you send another 1. Then you

01:29:58
start waiting 1 week, then you start waiting 2 weeks,

01:30:01
then you start waiting 1 month, then you send 1

01:30:04
message every month. Right? Because you don't wanna

01:30:07
send 1 message every 2 days for a year. That

01:30:10
would exhaust your volume. It would exhaust you. You would

01:30:12
definitely make your prospects angry. So you wanna space it

01:30:15
out the further down the line you go of them

01:30:17
not replying, but you'd never want to stop with it.

01:30:20
And the goal is nurture a relationship

01:30:23
and close the deal.

01:30:25
When crafting your follow-up approach, remember this absolute key principle.

01:30:29
And as the prospects

01:30:31
likely saw and read your previous message,

01:30:35
but there's a reason they didn't reply.

01:30:39
Your job is to overcome that reason by providing additional

01:30:42
value. And what I'm referring to here is the specific

01:30:45
copywriting of your message.

01:30:47
Something I see way too much of the time,

01:30:50
after having hundreds of coaching calls is that people

01:30:54
don't provide any additional value in the follow ups. They

01:30:56
think follow ups is a ticket to get out of

01:30:59
the situation easily. They think they can send a message

01:31:02
that says, hey. Did you say my last email?

01:31:05
Hey. Did you have a chance to respond? Hey. Did

01:31:07
you have a chance to look at my offer? Hey.

01:31:08
Did you think it was interesting? Hey. Just bubbling this

01:31:10
up. It does not work.

01:31:13
That is

01:31:14
putting in the minimal effort and expecting the maximal outcome.

01:31:18
It just doesn't work. That's not how the world works,

01:31:22
and it's not how outreach works either.

01:31:24
So the way you want to think about it when

01:31:26
you're writing your follow ups

01:31:28
is that every single prospect

01:31:30
read your first email, but they didn't reply. And there's

01:31:33
a reason they didn't reply. Okay? Maybe they didn't like

01:31:36
the offer. Maybe the call to action was too hard.

01:31:38
Maybe it was unclear what you do. Maybe you need

01:31:40
to include more case studies in the next message. Maybe

01:31:42
you need to provide more context. Maybe you need to

01:31:44
provide more proof. Maybe you need to add more additional

01:31:47
information to that initial offering.

01:31:49
And the reason I say this is what you always

01:31:52
need to do

01:31:53
is the 2 different scenarios here like we talked about

01:31:56
is you sending a message that's like, hey, just bubbling

01:31:59
this up. And the other option is you're providing additional

01:32:02
value.

01:32:03
Now you're sending an email where you're just saying, just

01:32:05
bubbling this up.

01:32:07
It has the potential of destroying it if they did

01:32:10
read the full previous email but they didn't reply. You

01:32:13
sending a valuable second email will never destroy the email

01:32:17
if it so happens that they didn't see the first

01:32:19
1. It's a simple equation of either you have a

01:32:23
50 50 percent chance of destroying it by saying, hey,

01:32:27
just bubbling this up and wasting it or you have

01:32:29
a hundred percent chance of bubbling it up by sending

01:32:33
value. So it just doesn't make sense to write a

01:32:35
simple no effort email. You need to put effort into

01:32:38
these emails and provide a value, provide additional context. Right?

01:32:41
That's what I'm talking about here. So value is the

01:32:44
absolute cornerstone of effective follow ups.

01:32:47
But

01:32:48
exactly what is value in this context? It's not just

01:32:51
about offering free services or discounts.

01:32:54
True value

01:32:56
in follow ups is about providing insights,

01:32:59
information,

01:33:00
or solutions

01:33:01
that can genuinely

01:33:03
be useful to your prospects.

01:33:05
And this is what I'm talking about when I'm saying

01:33:07
provide additional value context. Right? Is additional information, additional case

01:33:11
studies, maybe their competitors doing something, someone else in the

01:33:14
industry, anything that will help driving towards making a decision.

01:33:19
And making every follow-up counts, whether it's cold or warm,

01:33:24
every follow-up should add value. I cannot stress this enough.

01:33:27
I could probably

01:33:28
say this for 10 hours and people would still not

01:33:31
do it. It's so so important.

01:33:34
And here's a couple of examples of what you can

01:33:36
simply do. You can drop an industry insight. You can

01:33:38
share a success story. You can offer a quick tip.

01:33:41
You can hit them with data or you can analyze

01:33:43
a trend

01:33:45
in their market and send it to them.

01:33:47
And again,

01:33:49
how to approach the follow ups

01:33:52
is

01:33:53
expecting that they read your previous message, but they didn't

01:33:56
reply for a reason. You wanna guess what the reason

01:33:57
is and you wanna provide additional value to what you

01:33:59
think will fix it.

01:34:02
Now we're gonna get into the section where we're talking

01:34:04
about digital footprints.

01:34:05
And you might think this is outreach. Right? It's not

01:34:08
social media module. It's not course on that.

01:34:11
Very right. You might be surprised, but

01:34:15
in today's digital age, your online presence actually plays a

01:34:19
significant role in the success of your outreach

01:34:23
efforts.

01:34:24
When you reach out to a prospect,

01:34:26
they'll likely

01:34:28
research your agency

01:34:29
to learn more about you and determine if you're a

01:34:32
credible or trustworthy partner.

01:34:35
Here's what prospects actually go looking for. When prospects investigate

01:34:38
your digital footprints, they're typically looking for 4 things. It's

01:34:42
legitimacy,

01:34:43
confirming that you're a real, established

01:34:46
AI automation business,

01:34:48
credibility,

01:34:49
evidence of your AI expertise,

01:34:51
experience,

01:34:52
and industry knowledge,

01:34:53
consistency,

01:34:54
meaning alignment between your outreach message and your online presence.

01:34:58
If you're reaching out to someone saying I'm an AI

01:35:00
expert, we help businesses save 2000000 dollars a year and

01:35:04
then they go onto your LinkedIn and you sell hot

01:35:05
dogs,

01:35:06
they're not gonna reply. Let's be real. Okay?

01:35:09
And the last 1 is social proof. Testimonials and case

01:35:12
studies from satisfied clients

01:35:15
that validates your AI implementation successes. They want to make

01:35:18
sure that they're not gonna waste their time, waste their

01:35:20
money, or going to a rabbit hole here by talking

01:35:23
to you. So these are the first things I look

01:35:25
for. So how do we optimize our digital footprints?

01:35:28
To create a strong digital footprint

01:35:31
that supports our outreach efforts, we need to focus on

01:35:34
3 things. Your website.

01:35:36
Ensure that your website is professional, user friendly, and clearly

01:35:40
communicates your value proposition and services.

01:35:43
Include case studies, testimonials

01:35:46
with a clear call to action. When starting out, a

01:35:50
clean and tidy personal brand site can do the job

01:35:53
for the first few months. There's plenty of templates out

01:35:57
there

01:35:58
or Fiverr slash Upwork freelancers

01:36:00
who will do this for cheap.

01:36:02
Now you might be sitting here

01:36:04
freaking out now because I just told you, you need

01:36:07
to have this and this and this on your website

01:36:08
and you don't even have a website.

01:36:11
It's okay.

01:36:12
As I said, there is plenty of templates and you've

01:36:15
got freelancers and stuff on Fiverr or Upwork that can

01:36:17
do it for cheap. The whole thing here is that

01:36:20
you need just need to have something to show for.

01:36:22
Because if you're gonna go and buy a car at

01:36:24
a car dealership

01:36:26
and you Google the car dealership and they don't exist,

01:36:29
they sound like they can sell you this car for

01:36:31
cheap and do this miracle work of getting you a

01:36:34
Tesla in 1 week when it's let's pretend it's a

01:36:37
6 month wait time. You Google the website and they

01:36:40
don't exist.

01:36:41
That would be very fishy and would provide a massive

01:36:44
barrier to entry to you actually buying the car from

01:36:46
them. That will create a suspicious

01:36:49
intent for you that will carry along your whole relationship.

01:36:53
So something as simple as spinning up a quick simple

01:36:56
personal brand website is gonna do you wonders.

01:37:00
It should not take a lot of time and it

01:37:01
should not take a lot of money. This is something

01:37:04
very simple that can be done within the span of

01:37:06
a few hours.

01:37:08
The second thing is social media. Maintaining

01:37:10
active engaging profiles

01:37:12
on relevant social media platforms,

01:37:14
sharing valuable content and interacting with your audience.

01:37:18
Showcase your expertise

01:37:20
and build a relationship with potential clients. Right?

01:37:23
So when they Google you, people are gonna Google you

01:37:26
on the platform they are the most comfortable with. For

01:37:28
some prospects, that might be LinkedIn. For other prospects, that

01:37:30
might be Facebook.

01:37:31
And if you have

01:37:34
a super old

01:37:36
profile on 1 of these platforms, they are likely to

01:37:38
Google you on where you're half naked,

01:37:42
partying around, drinking beer, and that's their impression of you,

01:37:45
that is probably not a great first impression for a

01:37:48
business partner that they're gonna be paying a lot of

01:37:50
money that is gonna be responsible for a lot of

01:37:52
their operations and saving their business with AI. Simply just

01:37:56
not a good look. So make sure you're presentable.

01:37:59
And then lastly, we've got online reviews.

01:38:02
Encourage satisfied clients

01:38:04
to leave reviews on platforms like Google, Facebook, or industry

01:38:08
specific directories.

01:38:10
Respond to all of the reviews, both positive and negative,

01:38:14
to show that you've valued feedback and are committed to

01:38:17
client satisfaction.

01:38:20
On this,

01:38:21
you don't necessarily only have to ask for feedback and

01:38:24
reviews from clients that you had a full on massive

01:38:27
project with. If you've had a successful discovery call with

01:38:30
someone where you think they walk away with a feeling

01:38:33
of, wow, I really learned something. This solution and you

01:38:37
might be charging too much for us to become your

01:38:39
clients, but I really value what you taught me today.

01:38:43
And if that's what the clients are walking away with,

01:38:45
you need to stop John right there and ask him

01:38:48
if he can leave you a review because that will

01:38:51
really impact your business.

01:38:53
Anything

01:38:53
we have a positive interaction where people are getting any

01:38:56
value from you, you should be asking for a review

01:38:59
to build your review.

01:39:01
By proactively managing and optimizing your digital footprint, you'll create

01:39:05
a strong foundation for your outreach efforts and make it

01:39:08
easier for prospect to trust and engage with your agency.

01:39:11
Right?

01:39:13
I recently read a study that person to person trust

01:39:15
is the lowest it's been in the last 50 years.

01:39:18
So anything and any advantage we can get to building

01:39:21
this trust

01:39:22
instead of taking away trust is something we should jump

01:39:25
on, which is this.

01:39:26
And then a bit of a reality checker again, congruency.

01:39:30
Make sure that all your personal and business branding

01:39:33
is congruent across all platform.

01:39:37
E g, if your LinkedIn says you're a voice agent

01:39:40
specialist,

01:39:41
make sure that your website also features that somewhere on

01:39:45
it.

01:39:46
And if you have a public Instagram,

01:39:48
have something about voice AI in your bio.

01:39:52
If you don't want to use a certain platform, e

01:39:54
g

01:39:55
your Instagram is personal only, then make sure it's private

01:40:00
and what is visible isn't going to put off

01:40:03
any potential clients,

01:40:05
e g, you and your mates pulling the finger in

01:40:08
the profile picture.

01:40:10
Same thing we talked about earlier with the you're just

01:40:12
out drinking and that's your first impression. Not a great

01:40:15
look.

01:40:18
Nurturing,

01:40:19
the secret

01:40:20
sauce.

01:40:22
So nurturing is a crucial aspect of outreach that often

01:40:26
gets overlooked.

01:40:28
It can make all the difference in converting your prospects

01:40:31
into long term

01:40:32
triple a clients. In today's competitive landscape, it's rare for

01:40:36
a prospect to convert into clients immediately

01:40:39
after the first interaction.

01:40:41
Nurturing plays a vital role in keeping your agency

01:40:45
top of mind and building trust with potential clients over

01:40:49
time so you can nurture them in to becoming a

01:40:51
client.

01:40:52
Nurturing

01:40:53
is consistently providing value to prospects, guiding them towards a

01:40:57
purchasing decision.

01:40:59
There's a couple of key benefits from nurturing and reasons

01:41:02
we need to do it. Right? Number 1 is stay

01:41:04
relevant. It keeps you top of mind for your prospects.

01:41:08
It builds trust

01:41:10
by establishing

01:41:11
credibility

01:41:12
and reliability

01:41:13
over time.

01:41:15
And last but not least, you stand out. It differentiates

01:41:18
your agency

01:41:20
and strengthens your connection.

01:41:23
There's 3 goals when it comes to nurturing. Right? The

01:41:26
goal with nurturing

01:41:27
is an important aspect to understand.

01:41:29
It is providing credibility,

01:41:32
leave prospects with the impression of you being an expert,

01:41:35
make them an offer.

01:41:37
Offer them the next step in your sales process, I

01:41:40
e a consultation.

01:41:42
Top of mind, remind them of what you do and

01:41:45
make sure that you are top of mind. When you're

01:41:48
writing your nurturing messages and when you're nurturing your prospects,

01:41:50
this is what you need to keep in mind. Right?

01:41:52
And there's like anything, there's a couple of key aspects

01:41:55
that I need you to keep in mind to create

01:41:57
a successful nurturing strategy.

01:41:59
A nice timely follow-up.

01:42:01
Follow-up with prospects at regular intervals to keep the conversation

01:42:05
going and show that you value the relationship.

01:42:08
If you leave someone alone for 2 months, you're trying

01:42:10
to follow-up with them like you're still best friends is

01:42:12
a very hard thing.

01:42:14
Set reminders to ensure that you stay on track and

01:42:17
don't let opportunity slip under the crack.

01:42:20
Number 2 is valuable content. Right? Share valuable,

01:42:23
informative content that addresses the prospect's needs and challenges,

01:42:28
such as a blog post, case studies, or industry reports.

01:42:32
Aim to educate

01:42:33
and provide value

01:42:35
rather than just promoting your services.

01:42:38
Number 3 is personalized touchpoints.

01:42:40
Tailor your nurturing efforts to each prospect's unique situations,

01:42:44
interests, and preferences.

01:42:47
Use the information you gather through the research and previous

01:42:51
interactions

01:42:52
to create personalized

01:42:53
messages that resonate with your prospect. This is something that's

01:42:56
very important in the start. As you only have 5

01:42:59
prospects to nurture that didn't go through or that didn't

01:43:01
wanna close or that didn't go through the discovery phase,

01:43:04
whatever that might look like, If you only have 5

01:43:06
prospects that are in the stage of nurturing,

01:43:08
then you definitely want to do all of them manually.

01:43:11
As you start building up a bit of a database

01:43:13
and more prospects that needs following up with, this is

01:43:16
simply not tangible. You can't

01:43:18
personally follow-up and write personal messages for hundreds of people.

01:43:22
So then you can start putting them into buckets of,

01:43:25
say, industry or pain points or platforms they use that

01:43:29
you find relevant to specifically tell your message to that

01:43:32
group of audience and send them all a similar ish

01:43:34
message.

01:43:35
But in the start, as I said, I would start

01:43:37
out doing this manually until you get at least 10,

01:43:40
15 people that you're actively nurturing.

01:43:43
And then last but not least is multichannel approach.

01:43:46
Engage with your prospects across multiple channels such as email,

01:43:50
phone, social media, and SMS to build a stronger connection.

01:43:55
Different prospects may prefer different channels, so adapt your approach

01:43:59
accordingly.

01:44:00
If your industry

01:44:02
never ever checks their emails, there's no point of including

01:44:05
emails in this nurturing sequence. Right? Then you simply stick

01:44:08
to phone, email, and SMS. So tailor this to your

01:44:11
industry like everything else we've talked about. Now we're getting

01:44:13
into nurturing in action. Right?

01:44:16
Nurturing is an ongoing process that evolves as your relationship

01:44:21
with the prospects develops.

01:44:23
Here's the main steps of the nurturing process that you

01:44:26
need to be aware of. Before meeting,

01:44:29
keep the prospect engaged

01:44:31
with relevant content and insights related to their needs and

01:44:35
reason for them replying to your outreach initially. So if

01:44:37
you reached out to them offering to reduce their workload,

01:44:40
provide them with additional context, additional information,

01:44:44
insights, and studies on how other companies are reducing the

01:44:46
workload with AI before they actually show up for that

01:44:49
initial meeting with you. That will make you have a

01:44:52
higher show up rate.

01:44:54
And then we've got after the meeting. Send a summary

01:44:57
of the meeting

01:44:58
and stay in touch with updates

01:45:00
positioning yourself

01:45:01
for future opportunities

01:45:03
regardless of the outcome of the call.

01:45:06
Tailor this to how you felt the call went

01:45:09
and what their focuses are. If they told you over

01:45:12
the discovery call that they're really focusing on scaling their

01:45:15
company,

01:45:16
focus on that as you're nurturing them in to the

01:45:19
next stage of your sales process. So after the meeting,

01:45:22
send them a summary and then stay in touch with

01:45:24
them about what you feel was important to them.

01:45:27
Until you get on to the next stage, which is

01:45:30
the consideration stage.

01:45:32
Continue providing value while they are evaluating your proposal and

01:45:37
give industry insights from competitors

01:45:39
is a great example on how to do this consistently

01:45:42
for pretty much every single industry. So this stage is

01:45:44
after you've given them the proposal and you've given them

01:45:46
something to look at. Now you want to give a

01:45:48
bit of urgency on how other competitors

01:45:51
are already doing this and how they need to get

01:45:53
ahead of it.

01:45:55
And if you don't have any competitors,

01:45:57
share case studies, testimonials,

01:45:59
or studies that you find online

01:46:01
about a similar thing to what you're trying to provide

01:46:04
to them. And then again, last but not least, we've

01:46:06
got after the contract is signed.

01:46:09
Nurturing does not stop when the contract is signed, believe

01:46:11
it or not. You should frequently follow-up

01:46:14
with clients to provide them with insights on the market

01:46:17
and stay on top of it. This will help you

01:46:19
reduce the churn. The more you stay in contact and

01:46:22
the more you build your relationship,

01:46:24
the better relationship you will have and the less likely

01:46:27
there will be of churning. An example of things to

01:46:29
do here as well is starting to build a bit

01:46:30
of a personal connection with them. If you're going to

01:46:33
an expo or if you're doing something relevant to the

01:46:35
what they're doing, share it with them.

01:46:38
Send them a picture.

01:46:39
Right? Stay in touch with them and create that personal

01:46:42
connection.

01:46:44
And then we've got the looking ahead section.

01:46:47
Before we move on to the next video, let's recap

01:46:49
some of the key concepts we've covered in outreach theory

01:46:53
and outline some actionable steps you can take to start

01:46:56
implementing effective strategies

01:46:58
for your triple a.

01:46:59
Some of the key takeaways are research is the foundation

01:47:03
of successful outreach, allowing you to create targeted and personalized

01:47:06
campaigns.

01:47:07
This is also everything your decisions are gonna be based

01:47:10
on. The channel you pick, the way you reach out,

01:47:12
the message you do, the offer you give, the value

01:47:15
statement, the value proposition you give is all going to

01:47:17
be based on the research. So it's a nonskippable step.

01:47:21
Secondly, we've got effective messaging,

01:47:24
combines personalization,

01:47:25
compelling offer, strong value proposition, and a clear call to

01:47:29
action. They're the 4 components.

01:47:32
Thirdly, we've got metrics and AB testing are absolutely crucial

01:47:37
to understand

01:47:38
to be able to optimize your outreach efforts and improve

01:47:41
results over time.

01:47:44
Fourth is follow ups and nurturing are essential for building

01:47:48
relationship and converting prospects

01:47:50
into long term clients.

01:47:54
Lastly, your digital footprint plays a significant role in establishing

01:47:59
credibility

01:47:59
and trust with potential clients, so please do spend 2,

01:48:03
3 hours setting up a website that can actually showcase

01:48:06
you are a real person and that you are credible.

01:48:09
Couple of actionable steps based on what we talked about

01:48:11
today.

01:48:12
I know there was a lot of theory in this

01:48:14
module, and that was the goal of this module to

01:48:17
cover the theory and lay the foundations to understand everything

01:48:20
we're gonna be talking about as we're moving forward. So

01:48:23
there's not gonna be too many actionable steps,

01:48:25
but a couple of them, 3 of them are develop

01:48:28
your ICP,

01:48:29
Create a

01:48:31
detailed ideal customer profile for your triple a considering the

01:48:35
factors we talked about earlier like industry, company size, and

01:48:38
pain points. Use the document

01:48:40
linked in here where you can outline your ICP by

01:48:43
filling it in.

01:48:46
Secondly, practice your message.

01:48:48
Practice writing an outreach message using the 4 t framework

01:48:52
focusing on personalization and value proposition. Right after watching this

01:48:56
video, I want you guys to go find a prospect

01:48:59
within the ICP you've just created and pretend you're gonna

01:49:02
send them an outreach message. There's still a lot you're

01:49:05
gonna have to learn, but the best way of remembering

01:49:08
the information you've learned throughout this module is putting it

01:49:10
into action and actually using it a little bit. So

01:49:13
you guys don't have to send the messages if you're

01:49:15
not comfortable with sending the messages yet, but I really

01:49:18
would love for you to write them out and pretend

01:49:20
you were to send them so you get some practice

01:49:23
applying all these components and strategies we've talked about, all

01:49:26
the knowledge

01:49:28
while it's still fresh in your brain. Go do that

01:49:30
right now. Lastly, is optimizing your digital presence. Review and

01:49:34
enhance your website and social media profiles to align with

01:49:38
your outreach messaging and showcase your expertise.

01:49:41
So go through your social media and make sure they're

01:49:43
private if you want them to be. Make sure you're

01:49:45
presentable on different social media, and make sure you have

01:49:48
a website that people can actually look up.

01:49:52
In the upcoming videos, we'll dive deeper into the practical

01:49:55
aspects of implementing

01:49:57
these outreach strategies. Right? The next video is going to

01:50:00
be outreach mindsets,

01:50:02
developing mental frameworks needed to succeed in outreach.

01:50:06
The video after that again is going to be platforms,

01:50:09
where we're gonna explore key outreach platforms that helps you

01:50:11
to automate things like email, LinkedIn, and Instagram,

01:50:15
and where you need to go to get leads for

01:50:17
the different platforms, for the different industries, best practices, and

01:50:20
best platforms

01:50:21
that we know and we've used ourselves.

01:50:24
It's also gonna give you insights into where you can

01:50:25
go to hire people and a lot of extra tools,

01:50:28
and it's simply gonna equip you with every platform you

01:50:30
need to know in relevance to outreach.

01:50:34
The next video after that is going to be called

01:50:36
email setup. You're gonna learn all the technical essentials

01:50:40
for setting up your email, and we're actually gonna go

01:50:42
through the process together of setting up email accounts and

01:50:45
getting them ready to send out emails.

01:50:48
And the last video in this module is going to

01:50:50
be Calendly setup. We're gonna optimize your Calendly and configure

01:50:54
it for maximum efficiency

01:50:56
to increase your show up rates on meetings and create

01:50:59
automated workflows to follow-up and nurture your prospects.

01:51:04
By mastering these outreach techniques, you'll be equipped

01:51:07
to connect with potential clients,

01:51:10
showcase the value of your triple a services,

01:51:13
and grow your business in the competitive

01:51:16
AI automation

01:51:17
landscape.

01:51:19
Go take action on this, and I'm really looking forward

01:51:21
to seeing you in the next video.
