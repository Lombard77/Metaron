Now before we go any further,

00:02
what I'm about to talk about can be considered as

00:05
a spec.

00:07
The spec, it's tried and it's tested and put simply,

00:10
it just works.

00:12
That being said, as any successful entrepreneur will tell you,

00:15
certain specs will suit them and their style better than

00:18
others.

00:19
So use this battle tested spec and test away from

00:22
it.

00:23
Why am I giving you a spec? Why am I

00:24
not giving you a script? Well, put simply,

00:27
frameworks are way better than scripts.

00:29
Scripts are for weenies guys.

00:31
So use this battle tested spec and again, test away

00:34
from it. The idea for framework is it allows you

00:38
to go through pretty much any sort of conversation

00:41
and build a backbone off it and refer to a

00:44
skeleton in a way. If I give you a script,

00:46
it's like giving you a full human being and the

00:49
problem is not every human being is compatible with another

00:52
human being.

00:54
Now in my cold calling workshop, for example, if you

00:56
have seen that or if you want to check that

00:57
out within the accelerator, go ahead. I do give a

01:00
script. Why? Because my cold calls are about 5 minutes

01:03
long at the absolute most which means you can get

01:05
away with using a script. And when you're on a

01:07
sales call or discovery call, that 15 minute mark to

01:10
an hour mark can mean that every conversation you have

01:13
will be completely different. If you and I were to

01:15
have a conversation right now and then you said, hey.

01:18
Can we run this entire conversation back? I guarantee you

01:21
it would not be the same in in in many

01:23
ways.

01:24
So that being

01:26
said, use this battle tested spec and test away from

01:28
it for you and your product specifically and your service.

01:32
Are you ready to enter the rabbit hole?
