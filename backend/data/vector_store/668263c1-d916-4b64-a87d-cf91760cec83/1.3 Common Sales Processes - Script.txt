Welcome to module 3 of the sales section of this

00:03
course. Today, we're gonna be talking about common sales processes.

00:06
So without further ado, let's jump straight into it. So

00:09
let's talk about the difference between a 1 call and

00:11
a 2 call close. A 1 call close.

00:14
This aims to close a prospect within 1 call.

00:17
Now qualifying within this 1 call close system is imperative.

00:22
The last thing you want to do is fill out

00:24
your calendar for 30, 45 minutes, maybe an hour for

00:27
the next 3, 4, 5 days,

00:30
and you get on these calls and you're getting a

00:31
lot of low shows and your prospects just aren't qualified.

00:34
They don't have enough money. They don't have the problems

00:36
you're trying to solve or they're just from a different

00:39
niche or ICP altogether.

00:40
That's really just gonna stump you and your time, and

00:43
it's just gonna waste a lot of your efforts. So

00:45
make sure you're qualifying if you are doing a 1

00:48
call close is

00:49
on point.

00:51
Now depending on your style and your offer and your

00:53
niche and your ICP and whatever else it may be,

00:55
this can be more difficult a 1 call close.

00:58
Building rapport, qualifying disqualifying,

01:01
identifying problems or pain points, identifying solutions, identifying heaven and

01:05
hell, pitching your offer, objection handling, which is massive,

01:09
and enclosing the deal and signing the client all in

01:11
1 call

01:12
is a lot especially for newbies to the space.

01:15
So you have to do this all in 30 or

01:17
60 minutes which can make a 1 call close

01:20
seem quite daunting and a bit of a system that

01:24
usually the beginners won't really go for. And that's okay.

01:26
So let's talk about the 2 call close.

01:29
So 2 call close, you start with a discovery call

01:31
and then you move on to a proposal call. The

01:34
outreach process here can be what I like to call

01:36
a dirty laundry funnel. Now what I mean by this

01:38
is a discovery call is usually 10, 15, 20 minutes

01:41
long which means you can just sort of throw people

01:43
in there and sort out the laundry later. If they're

01:46
not qualified, we're only using 15 minutes and maybe you

01:49
can put them in a different direction or you know

01:51
bring them on later on down the track off your

01:54
off your triple act.

01:55
Now it's not a garbage funnel. You don't want to

01:57
just throw utter dog shit in there because you don't

02:00
want to get on these calls and really just have

02:02
to deal with people who have no money, are completely

02:05
off and don't even own a business or whatever it

02:07
may be. And again completely waste your time. So your

02:10
outreach process, dirty laundry funnel, think of it that way.

02:13
So on a discovery call, you start with building rapport.

02:17
You qualify and you disqualify which is the main sort

02:19
of point of

02:21
a discovery call to understand whether or not they should

02:22
move forward,

02:23
and then you identify the problems and pain points. You

02:25
introduce possible solutions maybe, and you start to just pull

02:29
the curtain back and uncover on heaven and hell. And

02:32
maybe,

02:33
maybe you start introducing your offer. Now this is really,

02:35
really good because a lot of the beginners coming into

02:38
the triple a space, they don't necessarily have an offer

02:41
or a niche specifically

02:43
targeted just yet, which is okay. A discovery call allows

02:47
you to build a rapport and qualify and disqualify and

02:50
see if, you know, is this is this something I

02:52
can help you with but also helps you to understand,

02:54
okay, what are your problems and how can I apply

02:57
solutions within the AI space to those problems? So it

03:00
allows you to make some more custom solutions

03:03
without obviously having to go through the entire process of

03:07
going, hey, I don't know what I'm doing. What are

03:08
your problems and I'll see if I can fix them?

03:10
So this can be really good for the beginners

03:12
within the space.

03:14
Proposal calls. Again, you're going to build further rapport. You're

03:17
going to reiterate problems with pain points which is quite

03:19
a lot and you're going to fully uncover heaven and

03:21
hell now. You're going to introduce your custom solution or

03:24
solutions and you're going to pitch your offer. And then

03:26
you're going to objection handle, which again is massive, and

03:29
you're going to close the deal and sign the client.

03:32
Depending on your style or your offer or your niche

03:34
or whatever else it may be,

03:36
this can be more difficult.

03:37
That being said, this is what I expect most of

03:40
you will be doing considering this is a more beginner

03:42
level

03:44
course. And obviously within the accelerator, we talk a lot

03:46
more about different common sales processes and different processes that

03:49
will work for you and your business specifically, especially on

03:52
approaching calls. Right?

03:54
That being said, this is what I expect you to

03:55
do.

03:56
Some people see a lot of success within the 1

03:58
call closed space. Me personally, I have quite an authoritative

04:02
sales style. So in my sales experience, I love the

04:05
1 call close.

04:07
I believe time kills all deals, but in this instance,

04:10
I definitely don't believe that. I believe this works

04:12
in your favor. Something to be said, the time between

04:15
your discovery call and proposal call shouldn't be that long.

04:17
Definitely don't want to be that long. Time does kill

04:20
all sales deals. So the last thing you want to

04:22
do is book someone in for discovery call, have that

04:24
call and say, hey, you're free in 2 weeks. They're

04:26
gonna forget everything you said, reiterating problems and pain points

04:29
that could have changed, and it's gonna be really hard

04:31
to

04:32
completely uncover heaven and hell all at the same time.

04:35
So your time frame should be honestly 3 or 4

04:37
days. At most,

04:39
5 business days, which is a week.
