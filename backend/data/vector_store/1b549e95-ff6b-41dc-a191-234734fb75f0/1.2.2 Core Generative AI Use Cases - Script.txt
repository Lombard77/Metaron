Okay. Now we're getting into core generative AI use cases.

00:02
Now that we have the solution sphere as our main

00:04
to model our lattice to hang things on, we're ready

00:06
to put everything we've learned together and reveal the core

00:08
AI use cases for businesses. In this section, you'll learn

00:10
exactly how generative AI has been used in businesses to

00:13
gain an edge. The hope is that by pouring all

00:14
of this knowledge into your head, you'll be able to

00:16
hop onto calls with potential clients and be able to

00:18
give them recommendations on systems that are proven to create

00:20
value for other businesses. Finding the good stuff. While AI

00:23
can theoretically be applied to countless business processes, identifying those

00:26
that drive significant value rather than those that are mediocre

00:29
can be difficult. The difference between the 2 is often

00:32
due to forcing generative AI to do things that it

00:34
isn't suited to do. As Einstein famously said, everyone is

00:37
a genius but if you judge a fish by its

00:38
ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole

00:40
life believing that it's stupid. This wisdom perfectly applies to

00:42
AI implementation for businesses and that success comes not from

00:45
forcing AI to do everything, but from applying it where

00:48
its unique capabilities create the most value. So there's this

00:50
nice picture that kinda summarize that Einstein quote.

00:53
But for a fair selection everybody has to take the

00:55
same exam. Please climb that tree. Now, obviously, I think

00:57
the monkey's really suited to that or the bird maybe.

00:59
But like Einstein's fish, AI excels in its natural environment

01:02
handling repetitive tasks at scale, processing vast amounts of information,

01:06
and maintaining consistency across thousands of interactions. Therefore, our focus

01:09
is on the core use cases that lean into these

01:12
inherent strengths rather than forcing AI into unsuitable applications, create

01:15
enough value to justify the investment as covered in AI

01:18
automation economics, and can be implemented reliably with today's technology.

01:21
The breakdown formula for all of these use cases that

01:23
we're gonna cover, we're gonna have these things. So firstly,

01:25
the core problem, fundamental business challenge that this use case

01:28
addresses, and why traditional approaches fall short in comparison to

01:31
the AI version. We have implementation options, different options for

01:34
solving the problem with AI. The solution sphere integration, how

01:37
the typical implementation fits into the solution sphere framework. We

01:40
have the inaction part which is gonna be a step

01:42
by step step theoretical example of implementations. The key advantage,

01:45
why this particular use case provides value to a business.

01:47
And community examples, actual solutions being solved by AAA members,

01:50
including pricing and results. Now, we have a lot to

01:53
get through here. I will be skimming over these. You'll

01:54
be able to access this document of course and go

01:56
through it at your own pace. But I'll be skimming

01:58
over the core parts of it here and leaving say

02:01
the parts here. We're giving examples of community. I'm not

02:04
gonna be covering those. You can check them out yourself

02:06
or just pause the video. So starting off with Copilot

02:08
Systems. This is 1 of the core use cases. The

02:10
core problem here is that knowledge workers spend a significant

02:12
amount of time on routine and repetitive tasks that take

02:14
away from their core value creating activities. Traditional approaches require

02:17
employees to manually handle everything from research to data entry

02:20
creating several challenges. Hours spent on low value administrative work,

02:23
inconsistent quality and routine tasks, limited capacity to handle increased

02:26
workload and valuable expertise trapped in repetitive activities. Copilots are

02:30
specialized AI systems for a specific role that handle routine

02:33
tasks allowing employees to focus on high value work. So,

02:36
Copilots can be deployed in various ways. You can integrate

02:38
them with say, Slack where people can chat away to

02:41
their own Copilot within a Slack channel. You can do

02:43
it through Microsoft Teams, it's a pretty popular 1. You

02:45
can build custom web apps around them. You can do

02:47
them through interfaces provided by AI agent building platforms like

02:50
Relevant AI which I showed you earlier in this section

02:52
of videos Or you can make them connected to, say,

02:54
WhatsApp if you need it on the go. And say

02:56
you've got a construction worker CoPilot and they you attach

03:00
it to a WhatsApp number, are they gonna ask questions

03:02
to it over SMS or WhatsApp? While these are less

03:04
common, they are definitely ways that it can be integrated

03:06
into, a workflow. The key is to make the Copilot

03:09
easily accessible within the employee's natural workflow like I just

03:11
said. For example, a sales rep's Copilot might include a

03:14
generic prospect background report, takes in the LinkedIn profile and

03:17
the company website, performs multi step research, generates insights based

03:20
on that and suggest the talking points of the call.

03:22
You might want another 1 for sales reps who need

03:24
to generate custom payment links on calls so you make

03:27
a tool in the Copilot so that while they're on

03:29
the call, they can type away to the Copilot on

03:30
the side of the screen and instantly create a custom

03:32
Stripe payment link and invoice when a prospect is ready

03:35
to move forward. And after the call, you can have

03:37
a post call CRM update process which automatically processes call

03:41
details and updates to CRM ensuring perfect record keeping, ensuring

03:44
perfect record keeping without manual data entry. So in action,

03:47
this may look like a new sales process being a

03:49
book and receipt through the calendar. 5 minutes before the

03:51
call, the rep requests to the Copilot a prospect report

03:54
and say, hey, I have a call with x y

03:56
z next. Can you please give me a report before

03:58
this call? AI compiles all the insights. It gives a

04:01
quick 1 page summary to the rep and then during

04:03
the call, the rep generates custom payment links instantly to

04:05
get people over the edge with a special offer perhaps.

04:07
And after the call, a quick voice member updates all

04:09
systems. And so this is how you make a sales

04:11
rep co pilot. You get impact on key metrics where

04:13
ad generated prospect reports increase the close rate from 20

04:16
to 23 percent by being better prepared. The instant payment

04:19
link might add another percent by allowing special offers that

04:21
can be sent. Accurate CRM data helps manage the swap

04:23
patterns adding maybe an extra 2 percent lift. The total

04:25
close rate improvement could be from 20 to 26. And

04:28
the sales rep monthly churn drops from 10 to 5

04:30
as they are spending their time on things that actually

04:32
matter rather than grinding away on up any CRMs manually.

04:34
Financial impact here, I'll just skip over that. You can

04:36
pause and take a look. But the key advantage here

04:38
is that beyond simple efficiency gains, these Copilot systems create

04:41
a compounding competitive advantage. While competitors employees split time between

04:45
admin work and valuation, your team can focus entirely on

04:47
revenue driving activities. This creates a double benefit you operate

04:50
with smaller more agile teams while simultaneously improving performance through

04:54
better job satisfaction and focus. The result is a business

04:56
that can scale faster and adapt quicker than competitors bound

04:59
by traditional operational overhead. I have a community example here

05:02
from Tim Kikia. He'll pause that and check that out.

05:04
Then getting into lead generation systems. Core problem is that

05:06
every business needs a consistent flow of leads to survive

05:08
and grow, but traditional lead generation faces major limitations. Businesses

05:11
can only engage with a tiny fraction of potential customers

05:14
due to human capacity constraints, and valuable opportunities are lost

05:17
due to delayed responses or inconsistent follow-up. The cost of

05:20
this can be significant. You're missing opportunities when prospects reach

05:23
out after hours, inability to engage with every website visitor,

05:26
valuable sales time wasted on unqualified leads, and limited ability

05:29
to scale outreach without proportional headcount increases as well. AI

05:32
lead generation system solve this by engaging with unlimited prospects

05:35
simultaneously 24 7 while a qualifying interest before any human

05:39
involvement. Some implementation options for this will be through conversational

05:42
AI like we've been through website chat bots, WhatsApp chat

05:45
bots, voice agents, etcetera. These are places where you can

05:48
create an agent that is connected to some kind of

05:50
interface. And when the customer or the prospect comes along

05:52
and wants more information, they can immediately chat to the

05:55
web agent or they can chat to the WhatsApp agent

05:56
or they can call up and they can ask questions

05:58
to the inbound voice agent. All these different ways are

06:00
allowing customers to get the information they need at the

06:02
right time. But lead generation systems will typically have some

06:05
kind of you could throw in a tool that offers

06:07
some kind of value like, hey, by the way, I

06:08
can do x y z for you. Would you like

06:10
me to do that? Okay. Great. Well, in exchange, could

06:12
you give me your details? Or, hey. Okay. Sounds like

06:14
you're ready to move forward. I can give you an

06:15
instant quote. Bang. You give them a quote, and then

06:17
you ask for the details so the sales team can

06:19
follow-up beyond that. So that's conversational AI lead generation, where

06:22
the customers wanna interact with. You have your AI agent

06:25
ready to go and and chat back and forth, answer

06:26
questions, and then move them towards a lead capture and

06:29
even to an appointment setting if you feel like that

06:31
as well. You have AI lead magnets which are slightly

06:33
different way. AI can actually be used to create juicy

06:35
lead magnets like we talked about earlier that provides some

06:37
kind of personalized value to website visitors, video viewers, cold

06:40
email recipients, and other forms of traffic. These are typically

06:42
an AI tool which expects some kind of input from

06:44
the user which is passed into a series of LLMs

06:47
or other functions like perplexity for web search which convert

06:49
those inputs into some kind of more valuable output that

06:52
they actually wanna get. So, and that's of course in

06:54
exchange for the contact information. So, so this can be

06:56
a great way to give away limited access to your

06:58
proprietary methods in order to generate leads. And can be

07:01
used as stand alone on a site with ads running

07:02
to it or it can be used in organic content

07:04
or can even be worked into an offer through a

07:06
chatbot like those discussed above as a way of setting

07:08
up lead capture. So, like I said, you could have

07:10
a calculator tool or a or instant quote generator or

07:13
you could have a free report creator. And it's like,

07:15
hey, if you give me these details, I can generate

07:17
this report for you and I'll send it to your

07:18
email, etcetera. So those are some lead generation methods. There

07:21
aren't many others which we're gonna touch on that are

07:23
kinda outside of the scope of these. But lead generation

07:25
of course a a big part of it and there's

07:27
many different ways to do it with AI. So in

07:29
action, 1 of these conversational systems would look a bit

07:31
like this. When the visitor arrives on the website, the

07:33
AI engages them, they answer questions on the product and

07:35
services, and then it mentions that it can give them

07:37
a free report on their business in seconds. All you

07:39
need to do is provide your site URL, generates a

07:41
report, and asks for the email and name so that

07:43
they can send it over. Captures this information and logs

07:45
it to a CRM. And the bonus would be that

07:47
it triggers a qualification automation to analyze the report and

07:50
decide if they're qualified and then update the CRM to

07:52
qualified, plus notification via Slack saying, hey, look, we've got

07:55
a new qualified lead. And so you can check out

07:57
the numbers here. As for the system integration, we have

07:59
the outer layer where the website chatbot is handling that

08:01
first touch. Then we've got a number of systems in

08:03
the core such as updating the CRM,

08:06
triggering follow-up sequences, and post sales call updating that CRM

08:09
again with information from the transcript. And in the middle

08:11
layer, you've got sales team using AI tools to prep

08:13
sales calls that pulls data from the CRM. And you

08:15
could also have a report generation tool for lead gen

08:17
too. The key advantage here is that while competitors only

08:20
with leads during business hours, AI lead generation systems can

08:23
capture and qualify opportunities across all channels 24 7. This

08:26
creates a compounding effect. Not only do you capture more

08:28
leads, but faster response times dramatically improve conversion rates. Each

08:31
interaction provides valuable data to further refine and optimize the

08:34
systems creating an ever growing advantage over late adopters. Use

08:37
of AR lead magnets can present much more value to

08:39
prospects, helping businesses to convert more visitors into leads in

08:42
exchange of personalized value packed outcome. Community examples are these

08:46
ones here. I'll let you pause that and take a

08:47
look. So appointment setting systems are next and they're similar

08:50
to what we've just covered but a little bit different.

08:51
Setting appointments is a fundamental business function that directly impacts

08:54
revenue. No meetings equals no business for many service based

08:57
businesses. Yet the traditional appointment setting process is incredibly inefficient.

09:01
It requires content availability,

09:03
consumes valuable staff time with back and forth communication, and

09:06
is limited by human capacity. And if you think about

09:08
it, there's also a lot of traffic that is run

09:10
through a typical appointment setting system of of having a

09:13
few appointment setters where they don't actually set like that.

09:15
They might have a 50 percent qualification rate. So half

09:18
of the work of all of the teams wasted. So

09:20
while you have to have you typically have more capacity

09:22
than you need because you've gotta dig through the rubbish

09:24
to get through the actual people who are qualified for

09:26
the offer. Right? So this naturally creates a bottleneck in

09:28
business growth and the cost is significant of not having

09:30
this sorted out. Lost opportunities when no 1 is available

09:33
to respond in the in the right time. People just

09:35
go to someone else for their needs. There's valuable employee

09:37
time spent on scheduling rather than revenue generating activities. You've

09:40
got inconsistent follow-up leading to lower show rates and limited

09:43
capacity to handle increased booking volume as you scale. AI

09:46
appointment setters solve this by providing 24 7 availability and

09:49
unlimited capacity while maintaining a consistent professional experience for every

09:53
prospect. Our options for implementation here are through a text

09:56
based platform like WhatsApp or website chatbot or through SMS.

09:59
We can do through voice based agents via like an

10:01
inbound AI receptionist or for outbound calls like you've got

10:05
a cold caller or a list re engagement agent that's

10:07
calling up your your old leads and asking, hey, would

10:09
you be interested in this new offer? Or through social

10:10
media platforms like Instagram DMs where they reply to a

10:13
story like DM me grow if you're interested and then

10:15
the seller jumps in and is able to qualify and

10:17
then set them if they're they are qualified. The choice

10:19
really depends on where your prospects prefer to engage. For

10:22
example, a barbershop might use WhatsApp while a b to

10:24
b service might prefer voice calls. So in action, a

10:27
barbershop might put this appointment center on WhatsApp, customer messages

10:30
the business number, AR responds instantly, checks live calendar availability,

10:34
books the appointment, sends confirmation with the details to them,

10:37
and then sends reminders via SMS automation to them as

10:39
well. The system integration for this is, there's 2 different

10:41
ways you could look at this, for a basic system

10:43
like the 1 we just covered. Just an outer layer

10:45
being WhatsApp appointment setter, with real time calendar availability,

10:49
checking and scheduling. And at the core, you put a

10:50
basic automation for the reminders or it can even be

10:53
done through Calendly. For a more comprehensive system like high

10:55
ticket services, you'd have the outer layer of a text

10:57
based on WhatsApp or Instagram handling the qualification and scheduling.

11:01
At the core, you'd have automated research on confirmed appointments,

11:03
and an outbound voice agent for confirmation calls and show

11:06
rate optimization. So as soon as they've been confirmed on

11:08
your end, you might send an outbound voice agent, to

11:11
increase the show rate like, hey, by the way, you've

11:12
got a call coming up in 30 minutes. Is everything

11:14
all good? And in the middle layer, you can have

11:16
sales teams using AI generated research briefs like we've gone

11:18
over many times now for meeting preparation. So the key

11:21
advantage is that AI appointment setting delivers more than just

11:23
scheduling efficiency. It eliminates traditional growth constraints. While competitors miss

11:27
bookings and waste staff time on administration, your business or

11:30
your client's business capture every opportunity instantly with perfect calendar

11:33
optimization. This removes a typical scaling bottleneck with hiring and

11:36
managing a team of appointment setters, allowing you to expand

11:38
marketing or enter new markets without the proportional increase in

11:41
overhead that limits competitors. This is a massive part of

11:43
it and the difficulty of training and managing and keeping

11:47
them motivated and replacing appointment setters when they churn because

11:50
they inevitably do because it's such brute force like mundane

11:53
work. This is a major benefit to the AI appointment

11:55
setting system is that it eliminates that need for having

11:59
such a high turnover team of appointment setters and training

12:01
them and managing them and making sure they're on schedule,

12:03
making sure you you they're showing up on time to

12:05
take over when the other person goes to sleep kind

12:07
of thing. It can be an absolute nightmare. So here's

12:08
an example from the community from Liam. I've got even

12:11
more from Isaiah, Brandon, and Sadar, all the all agents

12:14
of our community. Getting into knowledge retrieval systems. The core

12:17
problem is that businesses can accumulate vast amounts of information,

12:20
product details, processes, policies, expertise, but making this knowledge easily

12:23
accessible is a major challenge. You have staff wasting hours

12:26
searching for information, customers get inconsistent answers, and available institutional

12:30
knowledge is often lost or underutilized.

12:32
The costs are significant. You've got employees spending 30 percent

12:34
of their time searching for information according to some sources,

12:37
inconsistent responses to customer inquiries, knowledge bottlenecks when key employees

12:41
are unavailable,

12:41
and training new staff takes longer than necessary. AI knowledge

12:44
retrieval systems solve this by making all information instantly accessible

12:47
through natural conversation ensuring consistent accurate responses 24 7. So

12:51
this is basically just let's put all of the documents

12:53
that are relevant to a certain set of the team

12:55
or maybe the entire company and let's make a knowledge

12:58
base for that and connect it to an agent and

13:00
then connect that agent to somewhere that's useful. So, the

13:02
implementation options here would be a company wide internal documentation

13:05
helper that's attached to a Slack channel where you can

13:08
easily within Slack say, hey, what are we supposed to

13:10
do when x y z happens? Or who's supposed to

13:12
talk to about this? Or where can I find this?

13:14
Or Microsoft Teams if you're working with bigger companies. You

13:17
can have a knowledge based assistant that's niched down sort

13:19
of by specific departments e g the sales team knowledge

13:22
assistant or sales team assistant. You can have client support

13:24
systems provided to the customers for around the clock support

13:27
for common queries as well. So say for a marketing

13:29
agency client of yours, they might want 1 of these

13:31
systems where their client could always ask questions to this

13:34
knowledge based system about, oh, where can I find this

13:37
or wait, why are we doing this? What's the deal

13:38
with this? And it can answer those really annoying nagging

13:41
questions that can slow down an agency or cause them

13:43
to need to hire extra people for that client company

13:46
can

13:47
implement a internal documentation helper that an employee messages on,

13:51
Slack asking what's our process for changing YouTube descriptions. The

13:54
AI instantly pulls relevant information from the standard operating procedure

13:57
documentation it's got in the knowledge base. It provides a

13:59
quick clear answer and then also a link to the

14:02
full documentation. And of course, all of these questions are

14:04
being tracked and over time, it can be used to

14:06
improve the system. So how this works is based on

14:08
a vector database, which you can check out LLM field

14:10
work and AI foundations if you haven't already. Stores the

14:12
company documentation that preserves the meaning and context and when

14:15
someone asks a question the LLM understands that intent, pulls

14:18
out the most relevant information from the knowledge base and

14:20
creates a natural conversational way to access company knowledge that

14:22
feels like asking a knowledgeable colleague. So the system integration

14:25
for this would be in the middle layer, an internal

14:27
documentation assistant for employee use via Slack for example. A

14:31
human operated document ingestion tool for manual uploads. So say,

14:35
maybe you have a Google doc link and you wanted

14:37
to put that document into a new standard operating procedure

14:39
that you've written. And I wanna put this into my

14:42
sales department knowledge base. Okay. Well, I could go into

14:44
a tool that you create in relevance or something and

14:46
you put in here's the link to the Google Doc

14:48
making sure it's on view viewable by everyone. And then

14:50
you put in the, the tag. You could say this

14:53
is for the sales department and click enter or click

14:55
run and it's going to take that Google Doc link.

14:57
It's gonna be able to pull that information, put that

14:59
document into the sales knowledge base and then from there

15:02
on immediately, it's propagated throughout the system and any sales

15:05
rep who's asking questions to it will be able to

15:07
get access to that right and correct up to date

15:09
information. And at the core, you can have optional automated

15:12
knowledge base ingestion for new company docs. So if you

15:14
wanna do an automated system rather than a human operated

15:17
1, you can do that too. And so the advantage

15:18
of this is that these AI knowledge systems can transform

15:21
information from static resources into dynamic competitive advantages. While most

15:24
businesses waste hours searching for information or make decisions based

15:27
on incomplete data, organizations with AI knowledge systems give their

15:30
teams instant access perfectly organized contextual insights. This creates a

15:34
compound effect. This creates a compound effect. Employees not only

15:37
save time but work quality improves and everyone operates with

15:39
the combined knowledge of the entire organization. We have some

15:42
examples here from the community. You can check those out.

15:44
Another 1 here. Now, getting into AI personas. So the

15:47
core problem here is that expert knowledge and unique perspectives

15:50
are typically locked inside of your own brain, limiting their

15:53
reach and scalability. So whether it's a thought leader or

15:56
a coach or a subject matter expert, their ability to

15:59
share knowledge and interact with others is gonna strained by

16:01
the time and often their physical presence as well. Traditional

16:04
solutions like books or courses lack the interactive element that

16:06
makes learning from experts so valuable. So these AI personas,

16:10
they work similar to the knowledge system we've just covered

16:12
but with a little twist. So unlike the simple knowledge

16:15
retrieval systems we've

16:16
just gone over that just find and present the information,

16:18
AI personas are designed to embody a specific individual's personality,

16:22
expertise, and communication style. They combine a knowledge base of

16:25
the person's content such as transcripts, books, videos, etcetera. Like

16:28
you could do it for me. You could take all

16:29
of my YouTube content and accelerator content and create an

16:32
AI persona of me with carefully crafted prompts that shape

16:35
how they interpret and present that knowledge. The prompt engineering

16:37
is crucial. It defines not just what information to use

16:40
but how to communicate it in a way that matches

16:42
the original person's style and approach. So that is the

16:44
difference between an AI persona and just a regular knowledge

16:47
assistant. AI persona is a a more curated set of

16:50
data. It's like, okay, I'm trying to recreate Liam Motley

16:53
as an AI persona. I want an AI persona of

16:55
him that I can talk to and ask questions to

16:56
about my business. You can take a curation of my

16:59
best videos or course content and put it into a

17:02
knowledge base and then the prompt on top of that

17:04
is also crucial and you need to write it in

17:06
such a way that it transforms the agent into me.

17:09
Like you are Liam Motley, you do this, Your approach

17:12
is this. Use the information that is received from the

17:14
knowledge base in this way. So it's essentially prompting and

17:17
and programming the behavior of how the agent is gonna

17:19
act and its objectives and goals as well. It's like,

17:22
what is it trying to do? It's trying to help

17:23
people to understand how to start an AI business. And

17:26
the prompt aspect on top of the knowledge base is

17:28
how you define an AI persona. Common applications for this

17:31
include coaches and consultants, proprietary methodology and mentorship can be

17:34
scaled through AI versions of themselves, allowing students and clients

17:37
to get personalized guidance 20 fourseven. For example, a business

17:40
coach's AI persona can guide students through their methodology, answer

17:43
questions, and provide feedback on their unique style. These can

17:46
be built into standalone products and monetized also. So, there's

17:48
a monetization option for coaches and consultants who have some

17:51
kind of proprietary methodology. Business leaders can also use it

17:54
as well. For example, a CEO might use AI personas

17:56
for training and culture transmission by creating an AI version

17:59
of themselves to help new employees understand the company vision.

18:02
Or a manager might create a training persona to consistently

18:04
onboard new team members with their exact methods and approaches.

18:07
You can also do synthetic customer surveying. AI personas can

18:10
be prompted to act as a specific type of user

18:12
or client and then new products, features and pricing, etcetera

18:15
can be pitched to these personas and the persona will

18:18
generate realistic feedback. You will see an example from the

18:20
community at the bottom of this little

18:23
section. So in action, you'd have a business coach in

18:25
this example. The traditional approach would be, this is a

18:27
person who's got 40 hours a week for 1 to

18:29
1 calls. They charge 500 an hour and the knowledge

18:31
is shared only during these active sessions and it's limited

18:34
to geographic and time zones due to where they are

18:37
and there's no scalability beyond the time available. With this

18:39
AI solution, you can create an AI persona containing their

18:42
entire methodology and as much of their experience as possible.

18:44
This is offered as a low ticket product to those

18:46
who can't afford 1 on 1. It's available 24 7

18:48
to 4 student questions and it maintains consistent teaching style,

18:51
scales to unlimited students

18:53
and provides personalized guidance based on their approach. The system

18:55
integration for this would be an outer layer with an

18:57
AI agent that's been prompted to embody a person's communication

19:00
style and expertise with access to a knowledge base for

19:03
their accurate responses. You can prototype it

19:06
on GPTs. You can prototype it on Agentive. Agentive's good

19:08
because you can easily integrate it with whatever platform you

19:10
want. You can do it on relevance AI even. And

19:12
at the core of this, you can have usage analytics

19:15
generated weekly. So, that's 1 of the the really important

19:17
and valuable things of of these systems is you'd be

19:19
able to track all of the data and like what

19:21
are these people asking about most often? What are the

19:23
common questions? Where could I improve the conversions? Or maybe

19:26
I'm trying to upsell. What upsells was I able to

19:28
get? And yeah, like I said, conversation analysis and just

19:31
usage analytics will be helpful as well. And the key

19:33
advantage here is that AI personas solve a fundamental challenge

19:36
of scaling personal expertise and unique perspectives. They allow individuals

19:39
to extend their reach and impact without traditional limitations of

19:42
time and physical presence while maintaining the interactive personalized nature

19:45
of human communication. Unlike basic knowledge retrieval systems, they provide

19:49
not just information but the experience of interacting with a

19:51
specific individual.

19:53
Here's some community examples.

19:55
This 1 here is what I was talking about. As

19:56
you can see, Abby sold it for a lot of

19:58
money here in creating a multiple different AI avatars or

20:01
AI personas that reflected the different segments of a company's

20:04
user base. And so they could do real time market

20:07
testing and get a pretty good approximation of what the

20:10
different personas are gonna think of it. Then we have

20:12
mass outreach systems. So the core problem here is that

20:15
businesses need to reach large numbers of prospects, customers, or

20:17
stakeholders, but traditional outreach methods are severely limited by human

20:21
capacity. Whether it's cold calling, following up with old leads,

20:23
or reaching out to existing customers with new offers, the

20:25
manual approach creates a bottleneck that limits growth and misses

20:28
opportunities.

20:29
The options here for implementation,

20:31
we've got a bunch of them. What generative AI offers

20:33
businesses are conversational agents that can be used to reach

20:36
out to existing or potential customers and engage them in

20:38
a sales conversation. Instead of just blasting out the same

20:40
message then handling responses manually, the entire process from outreach

20:43
to appointment setting can be automated. Personalization of each conversation

20:46
is also possible at scale when sufficient information on the

20:49
person being contacted is available. E. G. When writing a

20:51
personalized email sequence, contact scrape from their LinkedIn or company

20:55
website is often needed. My point here is that we

20:56
have mass outreach systems. Sure. It's nothing new but the

21:00
key with generative AI is that like versus just traditional

21:02
cold email or cold DMing and things like this. We

21:05
have the conversational agent which can step in to response.

21:08
So say you're doing cold DMs as soon as a

21:10
response is received. It's not just okay, now we have

21:13
to go and get a human in there to reply.

21:15
Not only can you personalize the message that goes out

21:17
using AI, but you can also have a conversational agent

21:20
that jumps in when replies are received. Because 95 percent

21:23
of your your DMs or your cold emails are gonna

21:25
be completely ignored. So you're basically saving all of that

21:28
waste. And as soon as there is a reply, the

21:30
agent is stepping in immediately to answer it. So instead

21:32
of someone having to manually send those DMs out, you'd

21:34
likely be using an automation. But the conversational agent that

21:37
can step in to handle responses combined with the personalization

21:41
of the opening messages and and the sequences is really

21:43
where and generative AI shines. So businesses have several options

21:46
for AI assisted mass outreach, each with distinct advantages. You've

21:50
got phone calls being the most direct and hardest to

21:52
ignore. While email open rates hover around 20 percent, phone

21:55
calls achieve a 30 to 45 percent connection rate. AI

21:57
voice agents can now conduct natural conversations at scale, making

22:00
this previously expensive channel newly accessible. Previously expensive meaning that

22:04
you'd have to get actual people on the phone and

22:06
hire a cold caller to do it. You've got SMS

22:08
and WhatsApp where you've got high open rates but limited

22:10
by regulations and platform restrictions, best for existing customer relationships

22:14
or opt in lists. So you might be blasting, mass

22:17
outreach and conversational agents attached to that mass outreach to

22:20
your existing customer lists. Instagram DMs are good for b

22:22
to c businesses with a social presence but limited by

22:25
platform rules again and lower response rates. Instagram is pretty

22:28
tough around automation and things like that but you have

22:31
auto I G D M which is from the OmniFusion

22:33
AI guys which allows you to automate your Instagram outreach.

22:36
Reach. They also offer setters as well through their own

22:39
offer. And then you have email, mass outreach, sort of

22:41
the OG. Scalable but suffering from low engagement due to

22:43
inbox saturation these days. Even well crafted campaigns see 15

22:46
to 25 percent open rates and they can actually benefit

22:49
hugely from AI personalization. The game changer is that modern

22:52
AI can now handle 2 way conversation across these channels

22:54
instead of just blasting 1 way messages or rigid automated

22:57
flows. We can engage prospects in natural and even personalized

23:00
dialogue at scale. So you might be thinking like,

23:03
I've tried mini chat. I can tell it what to

23:05
say. I can integrate these different parts here and here,

23:07
and I can make a nice conversation flow. And if

23:09
they don't answer the right question, then they won't be,

23:11
qualified. But it's still limited by being a a sort

23:14
of rigid automated flows. And if you're able to get

23:17
a conversational agent in there to step in, you have

23:20
a much more natural way and and flexible way of

23:22
qualifying people and getting them into, your your calendar really.

23:26
So in action, this will look like a real estate

23:28
agent with a database of 2000 past leads and clients.

23:31
And they know statistically that 3 to 5 percent of

23:32
their list might be interested in selling their house at

23:34
a given time. That's 60 to a hundred potential listings

23:37
hidden in their database that they just don't have the

23:39
muscle or the time to find. Then we have traditional

23:41
options which would be to call everyone manually, a hundred

23:43
hours of work, hire an assistant for 20 dollars an

23:45
hour plus commission or like most people do, just do

23:48
nothing and miss these opportunities. So the AI solution here

23:50
would be an outbound AI calling system which loads the

23:52
database of 2000 contacts, AI calls everyone over 2 to

23:55
3 days, offers a free property valuation and mentions current

23:58
market conditions, makes a special offer or free professional photos

24:02
worth 500 dollars something like that. And if they're interested,

24:04
immediately notifies the agent and also sends them a text

24:06
message with further information about this offer. The system integration

24:09
for this would have at the front layer an AI

24:11
voice agent handling outreach with basic are you interested kind

24:14
of script. Nothing too complex. Hey, we've got this offer.

24:16
Would you be interested? Then a text message with a

24:18
link to fill out a form is automatically sent to

24:20
the interested parties. In the back layer, you've got instant

24:22
notifications for interested parties and form submissions. So those notifications

24:26
go into the team or the realtor. And then you

24:27
have CRM updates with with the call outcomes. So like,

24:30
hey, this person is no longer stale. This is someone

24:32
who's ready to sell. The key advantage here is that

24:34
AI outreach systems fundamentally change the economics of customer acquisition.

24:37
While traditional businesses are constrained by human calling capacity and

24:40
working hours, organizations with AI outreach can engage thousands of

24:43
prospects simultaneously across multiple time zones. This creates a scale

24:46
advantage. Not only do they reach more prospects, but the

24:49
consistency and optimization of AI interactions leads to improving conversion

24:53
rates. AI personalization of course can be a potent advantage

24:56
when trying to cut through the clutter in social and

24:57
email inboxes and increase those response rates. Here's some examples

25:01
from the community. You can pause and take a look

25:03
at them or hit them up on LinkedIn if you

25:04
want more information. I've covered a lot of these on

25:06
my YouTube videos as well when I break down like

25:08
the list of solutions so it's worth watching those videos

25:10
as well. They're all on my channel for you guys

25:12
to check them out. Alright. Next, getting into qualification systems.

25:14
So the core problem here is that high volume situations

25:17
create massive inefficiencies in businesses. Whether it's job applications,

25:20
sales leads, or potential partnerships, manually qualifying large numbers of

25:23
prospects is incredibly time consuming and often wasteful. For example,

25:27
talking to a thousand leads, 9200 will be a fit.

25:29
Means that 80 percent of the time your resources are

25:31
spent on dead ends. If you've got common high volume

25:33
scenarios being job applications, hundred or thousands per position, sales

25:37
leads from advertising with databases, partnership opportunities with channel partners

25:41
and affiliates,

25:42
and event registrations and qualifying the attendees and stuff like

25:45
that. The AI solution is that AI qualification systems can

25:48
act as intelligence, scalable filters that can engage with unlimited

25:52
prospects

25:52
simultaneously through various channels. You've got text based, systems through

25:56
WhatsApp, SMS, and website chat bots, and voice based systems

26:00
through inbound or outbound calling. In action, a qualification system

26:03
may look like this with a LinkedIn job ad campaign.

26:06
The scenario would be that they're hiring for a senior

26:08
sales representative. They receive 2000 applications. This is something they

26:11
just left open for a long time and and drive

26:13
a lot of traffic to. And they need to shortlist

26:15
the top 50 candidates.

26:17
So the traditional screening time is gonna be 15 minutes

26:19
per candidate AKA 500 hours. Traditional option to deal with

26:22
this would be to manually review them all which would

26:24
be impossible. Other 1 would be random selection. The other

26:26
1 would be first come first served which is gonna

26:28
miss the later ones that come along or it's to

26:31
outsource it to a recruitment agency which could cost 10,

26:33
15000 dollars. The AI solution would be an application form

26:36
that collects phone numbers. The AI voice agent calls each

26:38
applicant within 24 hours, conducts a structured interview and then

26:42
the system either a, evaluates the responses live during the

26:44
call using a criteria or b, records responses for batch

26:48
analysis against criteria,

26:49
via the call transcript. And from this evaluation, they can

26:52
do a shortlisting to get down to that top 50

26:54
that they're looking for. Maybe even a top 200

26:57
and then they shortlist down to the top 50 manually

26:59
themselves. But they've still saved a ton of work. And

27:01
the system integration for this would be an outer layer

27:03
with an outbound voice agent prompted with a set of

27:05
questions to collect answers for. At the core, you'd have

27:07
the automated transcript analysis to shortlist and rank these applicants

27:11
based on criteria and update the applicant spreadsheet. You've got

27:13
notification system for when a promising applicant is identified And

27:16
you've got automated email and SMS to send a booking

27:18
link for an actual interview, human based interview, to the

27:21
shortlisted applicants. The key advantage of this is that while

27:24
most businesses are forced to choose between thoroughness and speed,

27:27
organizations with AI qualification can process unlimited submissions or lead

27:31
or potential customers efficiently. Though AI screening may miss some

27:34
opportunities that humans could catch,

27:36
the dramatic reduction in time and resources creates a compelling

27:39
advantage. Businesses can see how their operations while competitors remain

27:42
constrained by the economics of manual screening. I've got a

27:45
a an example here from Jorge

27:47
where he's done it for a whiskey investment company and

27:49
a few more from the community here. Next, we have

27:51
the OG, the customer support system. The core problem with

27:54
this is, that customer support is a critical bottleneck as

27:57
businesses grow. You've got traditional support models that force companies

28:00
to choose between service quality and cost efficiency. Either hire

28:03
more staff as you scale or maintain a small team

28:06
and have poor service quality and and long response times,

28:08
which is usually what companies end up doing. Hey, we'll

28:10
get back to you in 24 hours. It's never a

28:12
nice thing to see as a customer who's paying these

28:14
people money and they say, oh, you're gonna have to

28:16
wait a day or 2 just to get an answer.

28:18
This creates a growth ceiling where businesses can't effectively serve

28:21
more customers without proportionally increasing their costs. Support categories, we

28:24
have 2 different types. You've got the pre purchase support

28:26
where potential customers are seeking information before buying. These interactions

28:30
directly impact revenue as prospects often abandon purchases if they

28:33
can't get quick answers. The challenge is providing instant accurate

28:36
responses about products, pricing, and features at scale. Then you

28:39
have post purchase support. So existing customers needing help with

28:42
your product or service. These interactions impact retention and referrals

28:45
and therefore indirectly impact,

28:47
your long term revenue. The challenge is providing consistent high

28:50
quality support across technical issues, account management, and service delivery

28:54
without ballooning costs. So the options here for implementation are

28:57
text based and voice based support, but modern AI support

28:59
systems typically operate in a hybrid model, just as a

29:01
bit of a disclaimer here, which is that they can

29:03
handle the majority of routine inquiries themselves, the current AI

29:06
technology isn't advanced enough to do complete automation of customer

29:10
support. Instead, these systems excel at handling 80 percent or

29:13
more ideally of common queries while intelligently routing complex issues

29:17
to human specialists.

29:18
This creates an efficient tiered support structure across various channels.

29:21
So via text based support, you can have website chat

29:24
bots, WhatsApp, SMS channels, etcetera, that allow businesses to meet

29:27
customers where they are. These systems can answer questions from

29:29
a knowledge base. And when the AI encounters a complex

29:31
issue or detects customer frustration, it can smoothly transition the

29:34
conversation to a human agent providing them with the full

29:36
context of the interaction.

29:38
Over a text based chatbot, this can be difficult depending

29:40
on which platform you use to build it. For example,

29:42
Voiceflow has options like this human handoff here and shout

29:45
out to Taha, who who's made this video here. He's

29:48
an OG accelerated member. And you've got voice based support

29:50
where AI customer support lines do a similar thing to

29:53
the text based, but they're handling inbound calls 24 7,

29:56
providing a familiar phone experience to normal customer support without

29:59
the staffing costs. And these systems can answer common questions,

30:02
route complex issues to the right team, perform basic functions

30:05
like checking order status, and also update records for the

30:08
customers as well. Like text based systems, voice agents are

30:10
designed to recognize when issues exceed their capabilities and seamlessly

30:14
transfer the calls to human specialists. This ensures customers always

30:17
receive appropriate support while maximizing the efficiency of your human

30:20
team. So in action, you guys can take a pause

30:23
and run through this. I'm not gonna bore you with

30:24
all of that, by me reading over it. But there's

30:26
certain advantages to if you're handling a thousand support calls

30:29
monthly to switching from traditional to AI solutions

30:33
here. And I will touch on this though. There are

30:34
enhanced versions of these basic customer support systems where you

30:37
can have a more AI receptionist style of system that

30:41
can answer the calls, book and manage appointments, and do

30:43
more than just answering questions from a knowledge base. System

30:46
integration of a customer support system like this, could be

30:49
an inbound AI voice agent that answers support line calls

30:52
with access to a knowledge base and 1 to 2

30:54
key tools, e g check order status or human handoff.

30:57
At the core, you'd have automated transcript analysis to improve

30:59
the knowledge base. Like what questions are being asked? Okay.

31:01
What do we need to actually update the knowledge base

31:03
with? You've got data and insights extracted and provided to

31:06
the customer support manager.

31:07
Like what are the patterns and what are we seeing

31:09
in these conversations the most? And the CRM updates to

31:11
maintain customer interaction history like what they chatted to us

31:14
on the fifth of April and they said this or

31:16
had this issue so that people are always aware. And

31:18
finally, the key advantage is that these AI support systems

31:20
can transform the economics of customer service by handling the

31:23
majority of routine inquiries automatically while improving the customer experience

31:27
through instant 24 7 availability. This allows businesses to scale

31:30
their support operation without proportional cost increases, breaking through the

31:33
traditional growth ceiling of support costs. So again, we're seeing

31:36
this pattern where

31:37
if you're answering the same question over and over and

31:40
over and over and over and over again, it does

31:42
not make sense to have a human doing it anymore.

31:44
They're better off doing the complex gnarly problems that need

31:47
the brains and problem solving abilities of a human. Whereas

31:50
customers actually from getting a fast response 24 7 or

31:53
at any time of the day. Getting the answer they

31:55
need and moving on rather than waiting for someone 12

31:57
24 to 48 hours to just give them the most

31:59
generic response that they've had to give to 5 other

32:01
customers in the past hour. Some community examples here, of

32:04
course, there's a lot of customer support systems out there

32:07
and our community is leading the way with that. Then

32:08
we have written content generation and repurposing systems. So the

32:11
core problem is that content marketing has emerged as the

32:14
most cost effective way to build brand awareness and generate

32:17
leads in the digital age. I would be the first

32:19
1 to tell you that. And unlike paid ads, posting

32:21
content is free and can generate huge returns. Every business

32:23
knows they need to maintain an active presence across multiple

32:26
social platforms but the reality of content creation creates severe

32:29
operational challenges that limit most companies ability to execute effectively.

32:32
Traditional content creation methods face several critical limitations. Time consumption

32:36
is perhaps the biggest barrier. Creating fresh and engaging content

32:39
for multiple platforms daily requires hours and hours of work.

32:42
A single piece of long form content a blog or

32:44
video can take 4 to 8 hours to research, create,

32:46
and polish or more.

32:48
Then adapting that content for different platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn,

32:50
Instagram, etcetera can take additional hours on top of that.

32:53
Quality consistency becomes nearly impossible at scale. When rushing to

32:57
feed the endless content machine, businesses often sacrifice quality leading

33:00
to subpar posts that can actually damage brand perception. The

33:03
pressure to constantly produce new content while maintaining high standards

33:05
creates significant stress on marketing teams. And platform optimization adds

33:09
another layer of complexity. Each social network has its own

33:11
best practices, content formats, audience expectations. What works on LinkedIn

33:15
likely needs a complete overhaul for TikTok or Instagram. This

33:18
multiplies the work required for effective cross platform presence. The

33:21
implementation for some of these written content generation and repurposing

33:25
systems, we have a few very powerful approaches to deal

33:28
with this issue. Firstly, we have content generation systems. This

33:31
is using AI to create original content from scratch, handling

33:34
everything from research to writing. A sophisticated implementation might include

33:37
an AI agent, research agent that scrapes relevant sources and

33:41
synthesizes key insights from say a competing blog post or

33:43
a competing YouTube video. Then you have a content planning

33:46
AI that structures topics and key points. Then we have

33:48
multiple LLM steps and passes to generate and refine the

33:51
actual content. Then We have platform specific formatting and optimization.

33:55
So aside from content generation, creating new original content, we

33:58
have repurposing systems. So these take your existing long form

34:01
content, podcasts, videos, articles, etcetera, and automatically transform them into

34:05
multiple formats through video transcription,

34:08
best bits identification and extraction, and content generation in the

34:11
tone and style of the original creator. So in action,

34:13
an automated short form content system,

34:15
for a business coach would look a bit like this.

34:17
The coach provides a topic, e g, leadership during organizational

34:20
change. The AI research agent would then analyze recent leadership

34:24
studies, identifies key trends and insights, pulls relevant statistics and

34:27
examples, and then their content planning AI agent would structure

34:31
insights into a compelling narrative, creates platform specific content plans,

34:35
suggests hooks and engagement points, and then the generation engine

34:38
produces 3 2 minute TikTok or real scripts with supporting

34:41
visual suggestions and optimize descriptions and hashtags. And the entire

34:44
process takes 15 minutes of the coach's time compared to

34:46
4 to 6 hours traditionally. The solution sphere integration of

34:49
this would be a middle layer mainly of just an

34:51
AI tool that is used by the founder, takes in

34:53
this input. Again, AI tools are human or agent operated

34:56
and they take an input and do a number of

34:58
steps and then give you some kind of output. Where

35:00
the founder or marketing manager will be using this AI

35:03
tool and takes in the topic, sends a generative content,

35:05
which takes in the topic and sends the generated content

35:07
to a Notion database for review. The key advantage here

35:09
is that the AI content systems automate the creation and

35:12
distribution of quality, consistent content across multiple social media platforms,

35:15
enabling businesses to achieve content velocity

35:18
without increasing costs. Compared to paid advertising, content marketing allows

35:21
businesses to generate leads for a much lower cost preventing

35:24
cash flow issues and making scaling far easier. So Shahz

35:27
here has a system for YouTube repurposing.

35:29
A bunch of other people have it in the community

35:31
as well. Next up, we have visual asset generation system.

35:34
So these are different from written content which is why

35:37
I've split them up here. Very different things but they

35:39
are both content generation systems on the list. The core

35:41
problem is that businesses require a constant stream of high

35:44
quality visuals these days for content marketing and any kind

35:47
of marketing really ads, anything you could imagine, branding packages,

35:51
product design, etcetera. But traditional methods are costly and time

35:54
consuming creating severe bottlenecks for them in the creative process.

35:57
Companies are forced to choose between expensive creative agencies with

36:00
long turnaround times or lower quality in house production, limiting

36:03
their ability to test and optimize creative variance. And I

36:05
leave it at in here, another option of just having

36:07
to spend a whole lot of money per month for

36:09
an in house team. And this directly impacts marketing performance

36:12
and revenue potential. As for implementation options, businesses now have

36:14
several options for AI driven visual creation each suited to

36:18
different needs. So we've got image generation,

36:20
the most versatile and immediately applicable. These modern image generation

36:24
models can create product photos, ad creatives, marketing visuals in

36:27
minutes rather than days. While early systems produce inconsistent results,

36:31
current technology can generate photorealistic images that match specific brand

36:34
guidelines and marketing requirements. This is particularly powerful for e

36:37
commerce and digital advertising where constant creative testing is driving

36:41
performance. I've covered this on my channel talking about the

36:43
ChatChippity 4 0 image generation model which can be a

36:46
great starting point for anyone looking to explore image generation

36:48
capabilities.

36:49
We have AI video avatars as well. We've got breakthroughs

36:52
in this technology allowing you to use HeyGen and Synthes

36:55
here in platforms like this that transform text script into

36:57
professional looking video content featuring AI generated presenters. This is

37:01
something that I'm actually experimenting with right now for my

37:04
channel and for business education programs with Horningside's business education

37:07
side. These things are going to be the future of

37:10
content 1 way or another and it's just how they're

37:12
going to be rolled out and who's able to take

37:14
advantage of them early on. And what they do really

37:16
is make video content creation scalable and consistent, enabling businesses

37:19
to maintain an active video presence across platforms without traditional

37:22
filming constraints.

37:24
Systems like HeyGen can create even multilingual versions automatically, expanding

37:28
global reach.

37:29
So if you're not familiar, hey, Jen.

37:33
They do these so you can provide a script and

37:35
you say, okay. I want you to say this, and

37:37
then it's going to you need to provide video,

37:39
of yourself,

37:40
and it creates a model like this of you and

37:42
then I can provide a script and say, hey Liam,

37:44
can you say this? And it's going to use my

37:46
voice and my likeness and generate video content that I

37:49
can use in YouTube videos or course content.

37:51
In here, we also have another 1 which is just

37:53
video generation models. We have Soarer and we have things

37:56
like Runway as well, which also offers a great option

37:58
for visual asset generation.

38:00
So image generation and video generation

38:03
are big opportunities,

38:04
and a massive value add if you can use them

38:06
correctly. You also have product visualization. So you can get

38:09
specialized systems that generate product images in different context, colors

38:12
and environments without physical photography. This is a massive

38:15
game changer for e commerce and anything that needs product

38:18
photos, allowing businesses to create entire product catalogs worth of

38:21
variations without physical samples or photo shoots. The game changer

38:25
about all of these is that these systems can produce

38:27
dozens or hundreds of variations in the time that it

38:29
traditionally took to just create 1. This enables true creative

38:32
optimization where businesses can test multiple visual approaches simultaneously,

38:36
adapt creatives quickly based on performance, scale scale successful concepts

38:39
across multiple formats, maintain consistent quality while reducing costs. So

38:43
in action, a system like this would look like an

38:45
e commerce brand launching a new product line. They need

38:47
new product photos, social media content and add creatives across

38:50
multiple platforms. A A traditional option would be to hire

38:52
a creative agency which is gonna cost a lot and

38:54
take a long time. Do an in house photo shoot

38:56
which might take a week and cost a lot less

38:58
but they're gonna get limited variation and and limited quality

39:01
as well or they can use basic stock photos which

39:03
is gonna be fast but not exclusive. The AI solution

39:05
would be a visual asset generation system which generates 50

39:08
plus product photos or even a hundred or 200 or

39:10
300 product photos in different context and out of these

39:13
photos, the best 10 or 20 would be taken picked

39:15
by humans and in a second phase used to create

39:18
ad creative variations with text and other graphic elements on

39:20
top of those photos. And within 24 to 48 hours,

39:23
they would have a full set of ad creatives, a

39:25
hundred of them that they can test for a percentage

39:27
or a fraction of the original cost. System integration of

39:29
this would just be a middle layer, a set of

39:31
AI tools for image generation that are used by marketing

39:33
staff to generate many variations

39:35
of these creatives on demand. So the key advantage of

39:37
these systems is that it transforms the economics of creative

39:39
production by enabling unlimited testing and optimization. As Mozzy says,

39:43
the top 0.1 percent of advertisers split test 11 times

39:46
more ad creatives than the remaining advertisers do. Businesses now

39:49
can find winning creatives through rapid testing rather than relying

39:51
on expensive creative expertise or gut instinct.

39:55
Got a few examples here. Matteo Trappella's got a really

39:57
interesting agency here that's kind of a generative AI creative

40:00
studio. That's a spin of the AI automation model which

40:03
is worth checking out. And some avatar work here and

40:06
imagery for real estate and marketing here. Next, we have

40:09
document drafting systems. So businesses face a critical bottleneck in

40:13
a document creation that directly impacts revenue and operational efficiency.

40:16
Whether it's sales proposals, contracts or legal agreements.

40:19
Traditional manual drafting methods force companies to choose between speed

40:23
and quality. Sales team will often wait days for proposals

40:25
to be created, contracts get delayed in the legal review,

40:28
and inconsistencies across documents create business risk. This traditional approach

40:31
creates a gross ceiling where businesses can't scale the document

40:34
production without proportionally increasing the administrative or legal staff. So

40:37
the options here, you can set up a AI document

40:39
drafting system like a a proposal generation system that transforms

40:43
maybe a sales calls, recordings or meeting notes into a

40:45
polished branded proposal using a relatively straightforward make dot com

40:49
automation. That content can be generated based on the transcript

40:52
and then be inserted into variables on a Google Docs

40:54
template or PandaDoc is another 1. This can create professional

40:57
proposals that would traditionally take hours to create manually. And

40:59
also you have contract generation as well. So similar to

41:02
proposal generation, input data like a proposal from perhaps this

41:05
step and a reliable contract template as well can be

41:08
passed into a basic automation that fills in some key

41:10
fields like the scope of work, contract value, payment terms,

41:13
etcetera. These AI systems can generate the first drafts and

41:16
minutes by understanding service requirements and the context about the

41:19
business and automatically applying appropriate legal frameworks and clauses. This

41:23
dramatically reduces the time to get agreements in front of

41:25
clients while maintaining legal compliance. The game changer is that

41:28
these kinds of systems can now understand context and nuance

41:30
in ways previously requiring human judgment. So instead of rigid

41:34
templates with simple field replacement, modern AI can extract key

41:37
information from natural conversations like your sales calls, apply appropriate

41:41
language and formatting, ensure compliance

41:43
and maintain the correct brand voice and style guidelines for

41:45
your documents. So in action, this would look like a

41:48
consulting firm handling 20 new client opportunities per month, each

41:51
requiring a custom proposal and contracts. They'd have to spend

41:53
4 to 6 hours on each proposal. They'd get a

41:56
legal review for 2 to 3 days potentially.

41:58
Template modification which can be prone to errors and multiple

42:01
revision cycles with the team. We have the AI solution

42:03
which will be a document drafting system that takes the

42:05
recording of the discovery call with the prospect, analyzes that

42:08
transcript, extracts requirements,

42:10
generates a proposal within 3 minutes, creates contract draft simultaneously

42:14
and routes them to a human for a initial review

42:17
and then delivers both documents to the client or potential

42:19
client in the same day. This look like a a

42:22
set of core automations that takes the post call transcript

42:25
and automatically generates the proposal draft and then it takes

42:28
the proposal once it's generated and generates the contract as

42:30
well. So you can see how these are kinda interconnected

42:32
but that information is coming from the sales recording and

42:34
just passing it through a number of AI steps. The

42:36
key key advantage here is that an AI document drafting

42:38
system can significantly reduce the time employees spend on mundane,

42:42
non value adding tasks such as document creating. This often

42:45
time consuming process which can take 30 to 60 minutes

42:47
or more per client adds up considerably at scale. By

42:50
automating document drafting, businesses can free up valuable employee time,

42:53
allowing them to focus on high value activities that drive

42:56
business growth. We have, Josh Hem here who's got an

42:58
example of something that he built to automate proposal creation.

43:01
Next up, we have data extraction and reformatting systems. So

43:03
the core problem is that businesses are drowning in unstructured

43:06
data trapped in various formats, PDFs,

43:09
scanned documents, images, emails, and digital files. Converting this information

43:12
into something usable, some structured data manually can be incredibly

43:15
time consuming and error prone. Whether it's extracting information from

43:18
resumes, processing receipts, or analyzing technical documents, the traditional approach

43:22
of manual data entry creates massive bottlenecks that limit operational

43:25
efficiency and increases costs. Companies are forced to either hire

43:28
large data entry teams or accept significant delays in processing

43:32
important information. So you've got 2 options here for implementation

43:35
or just 2 sort of main ones. We have text

43:37
based extraction. So for digital documents and text content, the

43:41
LLMs we have these days can process this unstructured text.

43:44
Meaning, structured text would be something like JSON and unstructured

43:47
text would be just a document like this where it's

43:49
kinda it looks structured to the human eye but the

43:51
structure doesn't communicate anything about the data, inside of it.

43:54
And with unstructured text like this document, you can extract

43:56
specific data points with a remarkable accuracy. Like you could

43:59
put this entire document in, send it to ChatGPT and

44:01
say, can you please extract

44:03
each of the core use cases, the titles of each

44:05
of them and can you extract

44:07
the implementation options for each of them and respond with

44:09
these in JSON format. And it will take all of

44:11
this information and it will go data extraction and reformatting

44:14
systems. In JSON, it will write this and it will

44:16
drop down another line. It'll have a little list and

44:18
it'll have these 2 here. And in a few seconds,

44:20
you can convert this whole unstructured set of information

44:23
into exactly what you wanted to pull out of it

44:26
which is extremely powerful. This technology can analyze everything from

44:28
resumes to technical reports, automatically identifying and structuring relevant information

44:32
that previously required manual review. Looking for maybe names and

44:36
entities or company names, anything like that. It can extract

44:38
out and give it to you in some kind of

44:40
JSON format or other formats that you want. Maybe it's

44:42
just a list. These kind of systems maintain consistent output

44:44
formats while handling variations in the input structure. That's the

44:47
key thing that it can handle very varied inputs and

44:50
it's super flexible because these models are so smart now.

44:53
Then we have image based extraction. So for physical documents,

44:55
receipts, scanned materials, etcetera. These computer vision models that we

44:59
have nowadays like GPT Vision are super easy to access

45:01
through APIs on things like make dot com. You can

45:04
literally access it and send an image to something within

45:06
make dot com and it can analyze it and you

45:09
can say, hey, can you please try to look for

45:11
x y z in this image and it will spit

45:13
out a response telling you if it's or not. And

45:15
this allows us to convert visual information into machine readable

45:18
text or other formats as well. Whether it's like detecting

45:22
if an entity is in an image or it might

45:24
be, let's look at a receipt and can you please

45:26
take that receipt information and extract all the text and

45:29
give it to me in JSON where it's like itemized

45:31
receipt. This is then processed through specialized AI workflows to

45:34
extract and structure the relevant data from the images. This

45:37
technology has transformed previously manual processes like receipt processing or

45:40
or document digitization.

45:41
But we are seeing leaps and bounds with this technology

45:43
these days where you can have a much more varied

45:46
set of use cases for it. And it may not

45:48
be extracting text out of images. It might just be

45:50
identifying certain things. Is this in it or not? Or

45:52
what or classification even? Is this image a this? And

45:55
you can route things based off that kind of classification

45:58
and using logic within your automations. So instead of rigid

46:01
template matching, modern AI can adapt to varying document formats

46:04
and output formats,

46:05
extract multiple types of entities at once and handle multiple

46:08
languages. So in action, we use the recruitment agency example

46:11
again. They've got a thousand resumes coming in monthly for

46:13
multiple client requirements. The traditional method would be manual data

46:17
entry. So you've got someone actually looking over and scrolling

46:20
over the whole resume and going, okay. Well, what's their

46:22
name? What past experience do they have? What's their email?

46:25
And manually putting that into a spreadsheet or they can

46:27
outsource their processing and they get someone else to do

46:29
it or they can use basic OCR tools where it's

46:32
gonna pass the document and try to extract the text

46:34
out which you're gonna get high error rates and limited

46:37
extraction capabilities. The AI solution or tune into AI solution

46:40
would be a data extraction system. So when a new

46:42
resume is received, it's going to trigger an extraction automation.

46:45
The data in that resume is then passed to an

46:47
LLM step and the key data from it like name,

46:50
location, past experience, email, etcetera is outputted in JSON format.

46:54
And at the same time, it automatically categorizes and shortlist

46:57
the candidates

46:58
based on their information and the criteria that was provided

47:01
for the particular,

47:02
role. And finally, once it's in JSON format, you've got

47:06
all of this data, it can be inserted into the

47:07
candidate database for review and basically flagged as like shortlisted

47:10
or not, good fit or great fit, etcetera

47:13
in the Airtable database. The system integration for this would

47:15
be a make dot com automation that's triggered on new

47:18
submissions, to extract the info and insert it into the

47:20
database. The key advantage here is that certain businesses have

47:23
high document flow like legal recruitment or financial firms and

47:25
they face a constant challenge extracting and structuring data from

47:28
countless documents. Manual processing is slow, expensive and prone to

47:31
errors, hindering scalability. AI powered data extraction eliminates this bottleneck

47:35
and with the right prompt, AI can instantly process documents,

47:38
accurately extracting and structuring data at scale. This automation transforms

47:41
operations, enabling real time decision making, boosting productivity and unlocking

47:44
scalability that manual methods simply can't match. Got a few

47:47
examples of them here.

47:49
If you wanna go through them. Now we get onto

47:51
our final core use case here which is onboarding and

47:53
training systems. Traditional onboarding creates a critical bottleneck in business

47:57
growth whether it's for new employees or clients. Manual processes

48:00
can be inconsistent, time consuming, and difficult to track, leading

48:03
to poor first impressions and reduced engagement. Companies face the

48:05
painful choice between dedicating significant staff time to hand holding

48:08
new relationships or risk high drop off rates with minimal

48:11
guidance. This creates a scaling problem where businesses can't effectively

48:14
grow the team or client base without proportionally interest without

48:17
proportionally increasing their training and support staff. So we have

48:20
2 implementation options here or 2 main types. We have

48:22
structured chatbot guidance, going back to what we talked about

48:25
earlier in this module. We have step by step chatbots

48:28
that can walk users through an onboarding process, providing immediate

48:30
answers to questions and directing them to the relevant resources.

48:33
This creates a consistent experience while allowing users to progress

48:36
at their own pace. The key advantage is 24 7

48:38
availability, real time support from the AI and the ability

48:41
to track progress in real time. So this is using

48:43
that voice flow style build. You may have to connect

48:45
it to a custom front end and build a bit

48:47
of an app around it. This allows you to say,

48:48
hey, can you please do this? Let me know when

48:50
you've done it. And then the AI can actually check

48:52
on the back end if they've done that by calling

48:53
a few APIs. Then you can have AI agent support

48:56
which is a bit like customer support systems that we

48:58
mentioned earlier but this time using conversational AI connected to

49:00
some kind of knowledge base or even other helpful tools.

49:03
And you can provide a round the clock set of

49:05
answers or answering system

49:07
for new staff or clients helping them to find the

49:09
training material that they're looking for, the documentation,

49:12
and video content as needed. So essentially, you create an

49:14
AI persona or just a document retrieval or knowledge retrieval

49:17
system and you give that to your new hires or

49:20
to your new clients like we've talked about before.

49:22
And they can ask questions to that and get information

49:25
directly and this can help them particularly if you're training

49:27
a new employee. It's like, hey, I don't even know

49:29
what the hell I'm supposed to be doing. Who do

49:31
I talk to? What do I do here? Oh, great.

49:32
I've got this sort of WhatsApp chatbot that I can

49:34
talk to or some Slack somewhere that I can access.

49:36
So rather than overwhelming users with a lot of information

49:39
at once, the AI can deliver relevant content based on

49:41
their current stage and specific needs. They can ask a

49:43
question to this agent and say, hey, I'm struggling with

49:46
this. What am I supposed to do? The game changer

49:48
is that these systems can automate the majority of a

49:50
business's onboarding or training needs which ramp up significantly as

49:53
they scale. If you're working with an agency and they

49:55
want to go from taking on 5 clients a month

49:57
to 15, that's a massive increase in onboarding capacity that

50:00
they need and a system like this would be very

50:02
valuable. So in action, if you look at a digital

50:04
agency who's onboarding their clients, the traditional option would be

50:07
a set of emails and calls, static documentation packages,

50:11
scheduled training sessions and ad hoc support requests. But with

50:13
an AI solution, you can have an automated step by

50:15
step welcome and set up process via a conversational AI

50:18
application you build and a dashboard to the business owners

50:21
to monitor the progress. So imagine that you're the agency

50:23
owner and you get to see where the onboarding process

50:25
each of your clients are and you can tell some

50:27
of your team to reach out to them and make

50:29
sure they're okay. And you can see sort of a

50:30
high level overview of where your clients are at in

50:33
the onboarding process. So how this would look with our

50:35
system integration would be, an outer layer where the onboarding

50:38
chatbot is set up via a custom web app and

50:40
middle layer with a dashboard instead of tools to monitor

50:42
the onboarding progress of staff and clients. At the core,

50:44
you'd have automations which trigger at key steps with the

50:46
onboarding and training process,

50:48
for the client's sake or for the business's sake. And

50:51
the key advantage of this is that manual onboarding processes

50:53
are time consuming, resource intensive, and can lead to inconsistent

50:56
experiences.

50:57
The onboarding experience is crucial

50:59
to kicking off a successful project or engagement,

51:03
and you can even insert things that increase revenue like,

51:06
hey. Please sign up to this, and you insert your

51:08
affiliate link. That's a a super easy 1 you can

51:10
get to try to claw back some of the revenue

51:12
you've spent on setting up the system. So you can

51:14
implement an AI powered conversational tool to guide users through

51:17
the onboarding process which can increase satisfaction and free up

51:19
business owners to monitor progress and analyze results rather than

51:23
doing it themselves. This automation allows for consistent personalized onboarding

51:26
experiences at scale 24 7. Here's a few examples of,

51:29
training or onboarding chat bots and systems built by the

51:32
community. And I think there's even 1 more here. Yep.

51:34
And so that brings us to the end of the

51:36
AI solution landscape. I think that's been the biggest section

51:39
of this program thus far. I hope you can understand

51:41
why we need to be so in-depth about this.

51:43
This is really what you're paying us for is to

51:45
give you this information. I've had to earn this through

51:48
repeated exposure to dozens and dozens and dozens of different

51:50
systems through Morningside by closely monitoring all the success in

51:54
this community and in the free community where we have

51:56
hundreds of thousands of people. I have boiled all of

51:58
this down into giving you this world view of the

52:01
AI solution landscape so that you can go out there

52:04
as an agency owner and actually know what the hell

52:06
you're talking about. So if that hasn't all sunk in,

52:09
go back and do it again. Do the quiz associated

52:11
with this. And if you aren't acing that, you really

52:14
need to go back and listen to this again or

52:15
dig through the documents. It's all there. Next, I'm gonna

52:18
be giving you a walk through of our solutions database

52:20
which is 1 of the most valuable assets in this

52:22
entire program for you to be able to go and

52:24
find things that are actually selling. Like I have provided

52:27
examples in this document here. But find actual examples of

52:30
things that are selling in the community that are proven

52:32
to work, that are proven to be sellable as your

52:35
starting point for defining the offers that you wanna start

52:37
selling to your connections or to offer through your social

52:39
platforms and things like that. So thank you guys for

52:41
watching. Thank you for sticking with us and I'm looking

52:43
forward to seeing you in the next video.
