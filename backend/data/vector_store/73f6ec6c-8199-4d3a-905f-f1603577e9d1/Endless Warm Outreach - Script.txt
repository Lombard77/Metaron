Everyone. Nico here, and welcome to Endless

00:03
Warm Outreach.

00:04
In this video, we're going to cover systemizing

00:08
consistent outreach

00:10
with daily habits, checklists, etcetera.

00:13
We're gonna go through how to grow

00:16
your warm network.

00:17
And lastly, we're gonna go through end of module steps,

00:20
which is a compiled list

00:22
of every single actionable step after watching all of the

00:26
videos in this warm module. Endless warm outreach.

00:30
You've already established

00:32
that warm outreach is 1 of the most powerful strategies

00:36
in your AAA toolkit.

00:38
But there's a catch.

00:40
It's only powerful if you can keep it going.

00:44
Many AAA owners nail the initial outreach, but then they

00:47
hit a wall when their contacts

00:50
run dry.

00:52
By understanding

00:53
how to keep these warm contacts coming,

00:56
you ensure

00:57
your most effective outreach strategy

01:00
never runs dry. In this video, we'll explore why consistency

01:04
matters,

01:05
understanding how regular warm outreach builds trust, nurture relationship, and

01:09
creates ongoing opportunities,

01:11
implementing consistent outreach, which is setting up effective daily routines

01:16
and schedules

01:17
to make your warm outreach a sustainable habit.

01:21
We'll go through growing your warm network, which are proven

01:24
strategies

01:25
for constantly

01:26
expanding

01:27
your contact list through active referrals and daily interactions.

01:32
And then we've got a biweekly

01:34
audit system,

01:35
which is a systematic

01:37
approach to tracking,

01:39
reviewing,

01:40
and maintaining

01:41
your warm outreach pipeline to ensure consistent growth. Systemizing consistent

01:46
outreach.

01:47
Consistent outreach

01:48
is the backbone

01:50
of successful relationship building in your AAA business.

01:54
It keeps you top of mind for the warm contacts

01:56
and open doors to new opportunities.

01:59
So why does this consistency matter?

02:02
Even if a warm prospect

02:04
don't agree to a meeting or a close in the

02:07
initial touch point, it's still extremely important to follow-up and

02:11
stay consistent.

02:12
Okay?

02:14
These leads

02:15
are a light year away

02:18
from a cold lead in terms of quality

02:21
because the trust

02:22
you've already built gives you a significant

02:25
advantage.

02:26
Use it wisely.

02:27
What I'm trying to tell you here is even if

02:30
you don't have a full lot of contact, a lot

02:32
of the people you can still follow-up with and stay

02:36
consistent with

02:37
throughout a long period of time.

02:40
So first,

02:41
before we move into everything else, I want you to

02:44
understand

02:45
that this is not a send a message and they're

02:47
used. This is if they don't reply, we're going to

02:50
be stay consistent with this over the long term.

02:52
And number 1 is relationship nurturing. Regular touch points, strength

02:56
and connections. For example, sharing a relevant article once a

02:59
month keeps you in your contacts thoughts. This is what

03:02
we talked about in the earlier videos as well or

03:04
at least touched on briefly, which is nurturing the relationships

03:08
to get and establish that credibility and that trust and

03:11
keep us top of mind.

03:13
A good example of this is actually, I post quite

03:16
frequently on LinkedIn.

03:17
And we talked about earlier how

03:20
engaging with your prospect on social media can be a

03:23
good approach to nurturing that relationship and keeping you top

03:25
of mind. And every single time I post,

03:29
I have 2 or 3 people that always

03:33
like my post, and most of the time, they comment

03:36
too.

03:36
Their names

03:38
are

03:38
burned into my mind, and I couldn't forget them even

03:41
if I wanted to. Because every single day when I

03:44
go in on LinkedIn, I will see a new notification

03:47
from the same profile picture, the same name, and the

03:49
same 3 people. They are extremely top of mind for

03:53
me. And And if they were to reach out to

03:54
me again now, even though I've said no to them

03:56
in the past,

03:57
I would definitely consider it a lot more than I

04:00
did last time. Let me tell you that. So nurturing

04:03
works. And then opportunity identification. Frequent interactions reveal new business

04:08
prospects.

04:08
A casual catch up call might uncover a need for

04:11
your services.

04:13
Businesses and markets

04:15
constantly change. And if you keep following up and keep

04:17
staying in the loop with these people, new opportunities might

04:20
arise. Maybe they had a competitor do that. Maybe now

04:23
AI is more compliant.

04:25
Maybe now they have a new department. Maybe now they're

04:27
starting up a new company, etcetera. There are many opportunities

04:30
that you want to identify, which you can do by

04:32
staying consistent.

04:33
Brand reinforcement. So consistent presence solidifies your triple a's reputation.

04:38
Each interaction is a chance to showcase your expertise. And

04:42
then lastly, it's the trust building. Regular and valuable interactions

04:45
build credibility over time.

04:47
Consistency

04:49
shows reliability

04:50
and professionalism.

04:52
If I get consistently contacted, consistently followed up with, consistently

04:55
engaged with, I can guarantee you that if those people

04:58
were to send me a message again, I would reply,

05:00
and I would probably automatically

05:02
be leaning toward that more positive side. Implementing consistent outreach.

05:06
Consistent outreach is crucial. We get it. Now how do

05:09
we apply this? Here's how you make it a part

05:11
of your routine. You're gonna create an outreach schedule.

05:15
You're gonna set aside specific times

05:17
each and every day for warm outreach. An example of

05:21
this is every morning, you're gonna spend 2 hours on

05:24
warm outreach.

05:25
Scheduling tape here is put this into your calendar for

05:29
first 2 hours every single day in the morning.

05:32
This will show you

05:34
you have no excuse

05:36
to not get it done first thing in morning so

05:38
you can actually go get some clients. Here's how you

05:40
do it. You open up your Google Calendar. You pick

05:43
the time you wake up. Let's say 7 AM. You

05:45
do 2 hours. You do morning outreach,

05:49
and you go into more options.

05:52
You click repeat

05:53
daily,

05:55
and then you make sure this is set to busy.

05:58
You save this, and you now have a work block

06:00
every single morning for your morning outreach. And daily targets,

06:05
When starting your triple a, warm outreach should be and

06:09
will be your number 1 acquisition strategy and priority.

06:13
Here's your concrete

06:15
daily goals.

06:16
Every single day, you're going to send 30

06:19
new

06:20
personalized messages

06:22
in your 2 hour work log.

06:24
In that 2 hour work log, you're also

06:27
going to send 20 to 30 follow ups to people

06:31
who have not replied yet.

06:33
This way, you're actively sending 50 to 60 messages every

06:37
single day in that 2 hour work block, and you

06:39
can actually get some clients. Now to summarize what we've

06:41
talked about in the previous videos, first, you're going to

06:44
use the messaging groundwork framework.

06:46
Then you're going to use the craft your message framework

06:49
in the previous sending messages video

06:51
to have a consistent and streamlined approach to sending these

06:55
messages

06:56
within your 2 hour time frame that we've just blocked

06:59
out in our calendar.

07:01
Now growing your network.

07:03
To keep doing warm outreach forever,

07:06
you need to consistently add new people to reach out

07:08
to you. That's not rocket science. There are 2 ways

07:12
to make this happen.

07:13
Number 1 is active growth. Ask for referrals.

07:17
Every week, you should be asking clients to introduce you

07:21
to others who need your solutions,

07:23
following up with prospects who weren't ready for your service

07:25
yet asking for referrals,

07:27
getting introduced to your connections connection. So if you know

07:30
someone in the triple a community that might know someone

07:33
that might need your solution that they can build, get

07:35
referred to them. If you have a friend of a

07:36
friend, etcetera, your connections.

07:39
And you should also offer rewards for successful referrals. Maybe

07:43
they get a percentage. Maybe they get a set theme.

07:45
Maybe they got a build, etcetera. And then actively look

07:48
for interactions in your daily

07:51
life, where you go to the gym, when you go

07:53
to grocery store, when you go to the barbers, social

07:56
events, etcetera.

07:57
Talk to people

07:59
and get in touch with people. This is the best

08:01
way of growing your really warm network because you've met

08:04
people in person. It's a big, big, unfair advantage.

08:06
Now that we understand this, we've got something that's called

08:10
a biweekly

08:11
audit,

08:12
which means every 2 weeks,

08:14
you'll use 2

08:16
of our main tools. You're going to use what is

08:18
called the biweekly

08:21
warm network audit checklist.

08:23
This is a new resource you're about to get introduced

08:26
to now. The second resource you're gonna be using is

08:29
the resource we've talked about before, which is the warm

08:31
outreach tracker spreadsheet. You know this 1. You're familiar with

08:34
this. Now I want to show you what the biweekly

08:36
warm network audit checklist looks like.

08:39
It's an extremely simple process

08:41
where your job is to go into the document once

08:45
every 2 weeks and check off all of the boxes

08:49
in all of the sections here.

08:51
Every 2 weeks, you're gonna go through every single step

08:53
and check them off. If you have to, print out

08:56
a piece of paper and write them off as you

08:59
go through. Once every 2 week, this needs to be

09:01
leveraged. And a bit of a pro tip here is

09:04
complete this audit

09:05
at the same time

09:07
every other week. That way you can do every other

09:09
Monday morning to build a consistent rhythm. You can schedule

09:13
this in the calendar the same way we schedule

09:16
our outreach work block in the morning.

09:19
That way you have no excuse of forgetting to actually

09:21
do this. This is very important

09:23
to be consistently having people to reach out to. Now

09:25
your biweekly tasks,

09:28
regular audits keep your warm outreach system running smoothly,

09:32
and here's exactly

09:34
what to do.

09:35
Section number 1 is what we call for contact growth.

09:38
You're going to complete the biweekly warm network audit checklist

09:42
that we just went through and showed. You're gonna go

09:45
through every single step and cross them off. And then

09:48
after you've done that, you're going to add all the

09:50
new contacts to your warm outreach tracker spreadsheets.

09:54
So this is number 1 of what you need to

09:57
do on a biweekly basis.

09:59
Step number 2 is what we call for system maintenance.

10:03
This is also very important to keep everything up to

10:06
date.

10:06
Step number 1 to doing your system maintenance

10:09
is reviewing your Outreach dashboard metrics.

10:13
You want to go in and look, make sure everything

10:15
is up to date. We've already run through this, so

10:17
if you haven't already checked out the video on how

10:19
to use the dashboard, make sure to go and watch

10:22
that. But go through the dashboard metrics, look over everything,

10:26
and see that everything is up to date.

10:28
Then you want to update all of the contact stages

10:31
and follow ups to make sure all of your contacts

10:33
is up to date. Is there any way you've forgotten

10:36
to add to your deal pipeline board? Is there any

10:38
way you've forgotten to update that answered you in a

10:40
message, etcetera?

10:42
And lastly, you want to make sure that your deal

10:44
pipeline Trello board has all the current opportunities added

10:47
from

10:48
your warm outreach tracker spreadsheet.

10:50
Now a bit of a pro tip here is set

10:52
a reminder in your calendar that repeats every 2 weeks.

10:56
This keeps you on track and make sure you never

10:59
forget

11:00
or have an excuse for not doing it.

11:03
This is detrimental

11:06
to your pipeline not drying up and is considered an

11:09
absolute

11:10
non negotiable. If you go into your calendar,

11:13
set a day that you want to go through and

11:15
do this, Set a work block of 2 hours, 2

11:18
to 3 hours is what you're gonna need. Click more

11:20
options, click does not repeat, and set custom.

11:24
You want to repeat every 2 weeks

11:26
on a Thursday,

11:28
and it never ends.

11:29
That way, if I say this, we're now going to

11:32
have a biweekly audit

11:34
every 2 weeks as you can see here in our

11:37
block. Now there's no excuse for missing out on this.

11:40
It should be crystal clear by now

11:43
that keeping a warm outreach endless is crucial for your

11:46
triple a success. Without a system to keep finding new

11:50
warm contacts,

11:51
even the best outreach will eventually

11:54
run dry. Now there's a couple of key takeaways I

11:56
want you to take from this video. Number 1 is

11:59
never stop growing. Your warm network must keep expanding.

12:03
They're both asking for referrals and regular audits.

12:07
1 without the other

12:09
won't work.

12:11
Number 2 is systems beats memory.

12:14
I can guarantee you that using your warm outreach tracker

12:18
spreadsheet and following the biweekly audit process ensures no opportunities

12:22
get missed.

12:23
If you think you're gonna remember something and that starts

12:26
stacking up, you're gonna have a terrible time cleaning up

12:29
these on a biweekly audit.

12:32
So make sure to consistently update them and use the

12:35
systems we've given you, not try to memorize things.

12:38
And And then consistency compounds. Regular audits plus daily outreach

12:42
creates a steady flow of new

12:45
clients.

12:46
Skip either 1 and your pipeline starts to dry up.

12:50
If you don't get more people to contact, it gonna

12:53
dry. If you don't reach out to people,

12:55
it's also gonna dry. So they need to work together

12:58
very, very important. Now there's a couple of end of

13:01
module steps that I want you to take after watching

13:03
all of these videos. These are all the actionable steps

13:07
compiled into 1 section that you can go through and

13:10
you can look at. So all the steps you need

13:12
to take throughout the whole warm outreach module is in

13:14
here. Step number 1 is you need to set up

13:16
all of your time blocks.

13:18
2 hours every morning for your daily outreach.

13:21
You need to schedule your biweekly audit time, which is

13:25
2 hours every other Sunday evening.

13:28
And you need to add a daily checklist time for

13:30
your Trello board right after your morning research.

13:34
Bit of a refresher here is that the Trello board

13:37
is where we move people to when they are interested.

13:40
So that's very important that we stay consistent and check-in

13:43
on where people are in the stages, what we need

13:45
to give them, what we need to follow-up with, etcetera.

13:47
So check your Trello board right after your daily outreach

13:50
in the morning. Step number 2 is set up your

13:53
tools. Make a copy of the warm contact management spreadsheet

13:57
and then create your deal pipeline Trello board from the

14:01
template. Customize the Trello board columns if you need. We've

14:04
talked about this before.

14:06
And familiarize

14:07
yourself with the spreadsheet's metrics dashboard.

14:11
There's also going to be a loom inside of the

14:14
dashboard

14:14
that you can always reference to understand what the different

14:17
metrics mean and what the different graphs

14:20
display.

14:21
Now at the end of this end of module section,

14:23
I'm gonna go through and explain what video you need

14:26
to watch for each 1 of these.

14:28
So if you're confused on where you can find the

14:30
deal pipeline board, hold up for a second and we're

14:32
gonna go through that.

14:34
Step number 3 is build your initial contact list. Follow

14:38
the contact scraping process in video number 2. You're gonna

14:42
wanna export your Gmail contacts. You're gonna export your phone

14:44
contacts. You're gonna export your LinkedIn connections. You're gonna scan

14:47
through your Instagram followers and the people you do follow,

14:49
and then you're gonna review your Facebook connections as well

14:51
as Facebook groups.

14:54
After you've done this, you need to go through and

14:56
add them all to your warm contact management spreadsheet.

15:00
Step number 4 is you need to go through and

15:01
prioritize all the leads you have in your contact management

15:04
spreadsheet.

15:05
So you're gonna go through each contact

15:08
using the framework from video numbers 3.

15:11
You're gonna mark the relationship level. You're gonna note your

15:15
connection point. You're gonna set an objective for every single

15:18
person and you're gonna see who to reach out to

15:21
first based on the prioritization

15:23
column

15:25
in the spreadsheets. Keep in mind that the prioritize section

15:28
is automatically generated

15:30
by how you fill in the columns according to that

15:33
person. So all you need to do is read off

15:35
which ones to prioritize first.

15:37
And then step number 5 is daily outreach routine.

15:41
You're gonna block out 2 hours. In this 2 hours

15:44
block, what you're going to accomplish

15:47
is

15:48
sending 30 personalized messages

15:51
using,

15:52
number 1, the message ground word framework.

15:54
Then you're going to apply the ACA framework, and you're

15:57
gonna leverage the message library

16:00
for inspiration

16:02
to the messages you're writing.

16:04
After you've sent 30 new personalized messages to your warm

16:07
contacts, you're going to complete 20 to 30 follow ups

16:11
to previous messages

16:13
that have not replied yet.

16:15
20 to 30 depending on how much time you have

16:17
left in your time block. Then you're gonna make sure

16:21
in the time block of 2 hours to move all

16:24
the positive replies you've gotten

16:26
into the Trello board.

16:28
So from the spreadsheet to the Trello board every single

16:31
morning in your 2 hour block that you've created in

16:34
the previous time.

16:35
And then lastly, you're gonna update all of your tracking

16:38
in the spreadsheet according to the outreach you've done today.

16:41
So all of the people you've contacted needs to be

16:43
in the contact section.

16:44
All the people who have replied needs to be in

16:46
the reply section. All the people who positively reply move

16:49
them to Trello, etcetera.

16:50
And then step number 6 is your biweekly maintenance, which

16:53
is every other Sunday. You can obviously change the day

16:56
here if you prefer so, but the end of the

16:58
week is a great day to do this. Now what

16:59
you want to do is you want to complete the

17:01
biweekly warm network audit checklist.

17:04
You want to add new contacts

17:07
to your spreadsheet from the checklist.

17:09
You want to review your outreach dashboard metrics to to

17:12
see that everything is up to par. You want to

17:14
update all of your contact stages and analyze and make

17:17
sure that everything over the past 2 weeks have been

17:19
tracked correctly so your metrics are good.

17:22
And then you want to ensure that the Trello board

17:24
reflects all of the current opportunities that you have and

17:27
that the Trello board is up to date with what

17:29
is currently going on.

17:31
And remember,

17:32
this is your number 1 client acquisition strategy.

17:36
Treat these steps

17:38
as nonnegotably

17:40
daily tasks. There are a nonnegotiable.

17:43
This is how you get your first few clients. And

17:45
if you can't do this, it's going to be extremely

17:48
hard for you. This is literally

17:50
step by step tailored.

17:52
And if you need any help, you can watch the

17:54
relevant video sections below, and you can look at what

17:56
information is in what videos.

17:59
I hope you've gotten some value from what we've gone

18:02
through here. I know there's a lot of information to

18:05
consume

18:06
and a steep steep learning curve to doing all of

18:09
this stuff at once.

18:10
I've been there. Trust me. I really know how it

18:12
feels. It's confusing. It's frustrating.

18:15
It's just all over the place.

18:18
I hope you've gotten some value from going through this

18:20
section.

18:21
I'm really trying to teach you the fundamentals of what

18:23
you need to know to really put this to action

18:26
and crush your first few clients.

18:28
Now

18:29
once you start doing this,

18:31
you're gonna build upon your knowledge, and there's going to

18:34
be things you're confused about, questions you might have. And

18:37
for that, us coaches are here to help you.

18:40
Book in a coaching call if there's anything you're wondering

18:42
about after watching through all of these videos, and then

18:45
we will discuss it together

18:47
and help you understand what you didn't understand from these

18:50
videos.

18:51
Again, really nice to be able to talk to you

18:54
guys.

18:54
Good luck with everything, and I'll see you on the

18:56
coaching calls.
