Hello everyone. Nico here, and welcome to the introduction video

00:04
for the warm outreach module.

00:07
In this video, we're gonna cover module goals,

00:10
module overview, so what you can expect in a few

00:13
coming videos here, the importance of warm outreach for your

00:17
triple a business, and lastly,

00:19
where warm outreach fits in in your overall acquisition strategy.

00:23
Welcome to warm outreach. In this module, you'll learn how

00:27
to get clients through the easiest possible method,

00:31
talking to people you already know.

00:33
These people are your pre existing warm contacts

00:37
and include people like your friends, old coworkers, or people

00:40
you've met before. It works better than reaching out to

00:43
strangers

00:44
because these people already trust you a bit. When people

00:47
trust you, they are more likely to respond and become

00:51
clients which is exactly what you need when you're starting

00:55
out your triple a.

00:56
Before starting this module,

00:59
make sure you've completed

01:01
the outbound systems foundations module

01:04
first.

01:05
It teaches you the core concepts that this module builds

01:09
upon.

01:10
So if you haven't watched that, if you don't understand

01:12
it, we're gonna be talking about a bunch of things

01:14
that's not gonna make sense. So make sure to go

01:16
watch the outbound systems foundation module first.

01:20
Goals.

01:22
This module is designed with 4 key objectives in mind.

01:26
If we hit these, you'll be well equipped to leverage

01:29
warm outreach

01:30
for your AAA success. Number 1 is set up your

01:33
warm outreach systems, which is where we're going to create

01:37
a warm outreach systems that will be responsible for getting

01:40
you your first few clients. Number 2 is mastering contact

01:43
management.

01:45
We'll show you how to efficiently organize and maintain

01:48
a warm contacts database,

01:50
ensuring you always have a pool of potential clients to

01:53
reach out to. And number 3 is crafting compelling messages.

01:57
You'll learn the key components of messaging

02:00
in warm outreach

02:02
and frameworks

02:03
you can leverage to craft your messages.

02:06
Bit of a side note on this is that we

02:07
are also going to include templates

02:10
for you guys to look at that you can draw

02:11
inspiration from.

02:13
Number 4 is establish consistent outreach habits.

02:17
You'll know how to set and meet your daily outreach

02:20
targets,

02:21
creating a routine that ensures a steady flow of potential

02:25
clients. This is very important. Consistency is king. Now a

02:28
bit of a module overview. Here's what we'll cover in

02:31
each of the videos in the triple a warm outreach

02:33
module.

02:34
Introduction, which is this video, will explain the modules contains

02:39
and explain how important

02:41
and where outreach fits into the overall acquisition strategy

02:45
of getting your first few clients.

02:47
In video number 2, which is scraping warm contacts, you'll

02:50
learn how to scrape and find contacts from relevant platforms

02:54
and put them into your warm contact management sheets, which

02:58
is something we're gonna introduce you to in this video

03:00
as well. Number 3 is setting your objective.

03:04
You'll learn how to set clear objectives and desired outcomes

03:08
leading you to being able to drive the conversations

03:10
you're having with your warm contacts

03:13
and essentially ask for what you actually want.

03:16
This is often overlooked and people don't really do it

03:19
too much and that creates a massive pitfall

03:22
where people don't even know what they are trying to

03:24
accomplish. So So trying to get that across to the

03:26
prospect and the warm contact you're reaching out to is

03:29
pretty much impossible, which makes this a very crucial step.

03:32
Number 4 is sending messages.

03:34
You'll get a clear idea of frameworks

03:37
of how to send messages

03:39
using Alex or Moses framework

03:41
with

03:42
examples. And then lastly, we've got endless warm outreach. You'll

03:46
get a clear idea of the steps and routines

03:50
that need

03:51
to be created

03:52
in order for this to be an endless process of

03:54
getting new clients.

03:55
This is not a 1 time reaching out to the

03:57
people you know. This is something consistent

04:00
that should be going on throughout your whole triple a

04:02
journey. Now the importance of warm outreach for your triple

04:05
a business. First of all, warm outreach is a targeted

04:08
communication strategy, meaning not mass marketing, it's 1 on 1

04:11
that focuses on connecting with individuals

04:14
who already

04:16
have some level of familiarity with you, your brand or

04:20
your services.

04:21
This is very important.

04:23
In the context of a triple a business, warm outreach

04:25
is the process of leveraging existing relationship

04:28
to create meaningful connections that can lead to business opportunities,

04:31
which is obviously the goal here.

04:34
Here. So why does warm outreach really matter for triple

04:36
a's? Number 1, it's got higher response rates.

04:39
Warm contacts are much more likely to engage with your

04:41
messages

04:43
leading to better conversation rates. Number 2 is trust and

04:47
credibility.

04:48
Preexisting connections

04:49
provide a foundation of trust making it easier to showcase

04:53
your triple a's value.

04:55
Number 3 is a personalized approach. Warm outreach allows for

04:59
highly tailored communication

05:01
resonating more deeply with potential clients because these are very

05:05
high intent leads is what we call them for. They

05:08
are much more likely of answering. They're much more likely

05:11
of having a meeting with us. Everything is a lot

05:13
more likely which means we should spend a lot more

05:15
time on them which allows us to tailor all of

05:18
our communication to each 1 of these leads because our

05:20
time is definitely worth it. Number 4 is efficient use

05:23
of resources. Focusing on warm outreach often yields better results

05:28
with less time and effort compared to cold outreach

05:32
and this comes from a person that literally runs a

05:35
company in cold outreach so I need to say I'm

05:37
a bit biased

05:38
and even then, I will still say that warm outreach

05:42
will yield you better results. So take that for what

05:44
it's worth. Number 5 is long term relationship building. Warm

05:47
outreach nurtures connections over time creating a network of potential

05:51
clients, partners and advocates for your triple a. We're gonna

05:55
talk a lot more about this later but essentially,

05:57
if there is someone you've spoken to before and you

05:59
manage to rekindle that connection you had when you met

06:02
for dinner, maybe a business trip, whatever that might have

06:04
been years ago, you can rekindle that connection and even

06:08
if they're not gonna become a client, they might become

06:11
very valuable in terms of networking. They might know other

06:14
people. They might advocate. They might understand what you do,

06:17
etcetera.

06:18
So long term relationship building

06:20
is something really useful.

06:21
Number 6 is insights into client needs. Existing relationships

06:25
often provide more valuable context about potential clients' challenges and

06:30
needs. People trust you enough to be honest with them

06:33
so you're gonna get to know what they really struggle

06:36
with which gives you some really, really actionable and valuable

06:39
insights. Number 7 is the competitive edge. In the fast

06:42
paced AI industry,

06:43
strong relationships

06:45
can set your triple a apart from competitors and it

06:47
probably

06:48
will. If I know someone that runs a company within

06:51
what I'm trying to achieve, I'm gonna go to that

06:53
person before I go to some random person that I

06:55
have no clue who is where the trust has to

06:57
be established.

06:58
So definitely big, big competitive edge.

07:01
So where does all of this fit in in our

07:04
actual acquisition strategy? Warm outreach is 1 of the pillars

07:08
when it comes to overall acquisition strategy

07:11
that should be highly prioritized

07:13
and is an ongoing process. Here we can see it

07:16
in the triple a roadmap. And then we've got summary.

07:19
You now understand that warm outreach is your most powerful

07:22
client acquisition strategy when you're starting your triple a. These

07:26
leads are

07:28
infinitely

07:29
more valuable than cold outreach because you already have a

07:32
foundation of trust, which is a massive, massive unfair advantage.

07:36
The main takeaway from this video here

07:39
is warm over cold.

07:41
Warm outreach

07:42
should be your number 1 priority when starting out. These

07:46
leads are significantly

07:48
more likely to convert

07:50
because

07:51
they already know and trust you. Very important. Main takeaway

07:55
is warm over cold.

07:57
Now let's jump into the next video and have a

07:59
look at how do we scrape these people that we

08:01
already know.
