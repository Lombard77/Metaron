2.1 Scraping Warm Contacts ðŸ‘¤.pdf



00:00
Hello everyone. Nico here and welcome to scraping

00:04
warm contacts.

00:05
In this video, we're going to cover

00:08
warm outreach tracker which is essentially a resource we built

00:11
you guys so you guys can organize and maintain your

00:14
warm contacts and keep track of everything. We're gonna walk

00:17
through another resource we built for you guys, which is

00:19
a deal pipeline board. Then we're gonna walk through the

00:22
strategy

00:23
of

00:23
identifying

00:24
the warm contacts we do have. Then we're gonna scrape

00:27
the contacts we have identified,

00:30
and lastly we're gonna be prioritizing the contacts we've scraped

00:34
inside of our warm outreach tracker. Now that you understand

00:38
the power of warm outreach for your triple a, it's

00:40
time to build your arsenal of contacts.

00:43
Many AAA owners underestimate

00:46
the wealth of connections they already

00:49
have.

00:50
Your existing network is a goldmine of potential clients and

00:55
referrals,

00:56
but

00:57
manually sorting through various platforms can be a very time

01:01
consuming

01:02
nightmare.

01:03
So let's walk through how exactly to do this efficiently.

01:07
In this video, we'll explore 4 main things. The strategy

01:11
for identifying

01:12
warm contacts

01:13
and what really makes a warm contact for your triple

01:17
a, advanced contact scraping, which is uncovering

01:20
warm leads across various platforms automatically,

01:25
contact management mastery which is templated documents and resources that

01:29
you guys get to leverage for organizing and leveraging your

01:32
warm network efficiently and keeping track of who reaching out

01:35
to you, where there are in the stage, etcetera.

01:38
And lastly, we're gonna walk through the prioritizing these contacts

01:41
that we have, where the goal is to focus on

01:44
the most valuable connections

01:46
in our resource, which we're gonna go through in just

01:49
a second. Now the first thing is contact management mastery.

01:52
Effective contact management is the backbone of successful outreach.

01:57
Your warm outreach system

01:59
contains of 2 essential components

02:02
that work together

02:03
to help you manage leads effectively.

02:06
Number 1 is a warm outreach tracker, which is a

02:09
spreadsheet template we've made for you guys.

02:12
Number 2 is a deal pipeline board and it's a

02:16
Trello

02:17
template that we've also made for you guys.

02:20
First, let's explain what the warm outreach tracker is, how

02:23
to use it, and how you can get your hands

02:25
on it. This is a spreadsheet

02:27
that is your center database for managing all your warm

02:31
contacts.

02:33
And then setting up your warm outreach tracker, you're gonna

02:36
open the template which is attached below this video.

02:40
You're gonna click file in the top left corner, click

02:44
make a copy, give it a name, and now you

02:46
own a version that you can edit. This spreadsheet

02:50
will help you manage and track your warm contacts.

02:53
It will help you visualize

02:55
where your contacts are in the outreach process.

02:58
It will help you monitor

03:00
who is at what stage and it will give you

03:02
access to a dashboard with insights about number of leads

03:06
yet to contact, so what's your leisure room.

03:10
It'll give you insights on industry distribution in your network,

03:13
how many are in x y and z industry percentage

03:15
wise, same with titles, headlines, all that kind of stuff.

03:18
And then you get a ton of other key metrics.

03:20
I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna show you this.

03:23
So this is a look at what the warm outreach

03:26
tracker looks like. As you can see, it's all looking

03:29
good pretty and it's all labeled over here in the

03:32
columns. So you're gonna be leveraging this as well as

03:34
these sections over here. First thing I'm gonna do is

03:37
I'm gonna input my full name. I'm gonna skip the

03:40
priority level column because we're gonna do that in a

03:42
second. I'm gonna input the company name. I'm going to

03:45
contact this person on email. He is the CEO of

03:49
the company

03:50
and he is in marketing.

03:52
Then Then we're gonna put his email

03:54
over here, contact information.

03:57
And then we're gonna keep the stage columns at yet

04:00
to start and no reply yet because we obviously haven't

04:02
reached out to him yet. And then notes over here,

04:05
we could do runs a cold email company. So we

04:08
have some notes on them. And then over here, the

04:11
next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna do the

04:12
same row we've just inputted him in. Row number 10,

04:15
we're gonna go over to this section and input so

04:18
we get our priority level. Let's pretend that he's not

04:20
a great niche alignment for what we're looking to achieve

04:22
and the niche we want to work within. So it's

04:24
a 1. However, he is my best friend.

04:27
So connection strength is definitely 3. He has all the

04:31
decision maker power because he's the CEO, founder, owner, and

04:34
then network access. Let's pretend this is a 3. Now

04:37
when we assign all of these, we have a variable

04:39
over here that automatically populates the priority

04:43
based on what you've inputted over here.

04:46
It will also get color graded with the highest priority

04:50
in your list being the brightest. So if I were

04:53
to remove

04:54
10 here, 9 would be the brightest color. This is

04:57
just an easy way

04:59
to easily see and figure out who is the highest

05:01
priority level currently.

05:03
You can also filter by this if you want and

05:05
sort by clicking the column over here over here.

05:09
Then once we contact Nikolai, we're going to change this

05:12
column to contacted.

05:13
We're gonna be following up with Nikolai.

05:15
And then once he replies, we could do conversating

05:19
and he had a positive reply. He was really

05:22
interested in what I had to offer him essentially.

05:24
And then once we agree to a meeting, we're gonna

05:26
go over here. We're gonna set this to complete and

05:28
then we're gonna input him into the Trello board. Once

05:31
we've added into the Trello board, we're gonna go over

05:33
to this section. I'm going to leave this empty because

05:36
I want to show you something at the dashboard level.

05:39
So at the end of your document here, at the

05:41
bottom, you're gonna have 2 sheets. 1 is called prospects,

05:45
1 is called dashboard.

05:46
If you click the dashboard 1, you get brought to

05:49
this section over here. And in this section, we've got

05:52
tons of information about the people in our list. This

05:54
over here, all of these 3 rows, they automatically populate

05:58
once you put someone into the prospect sheet. So if

06:01
I put test into here, this will automatically populate down

06:05
in the same over here as you can see. So

06:08
the more people you input

06:09
in here, the more people you're gonna have in your

06:11
dashboard over here. And the idea with this is that

06:14
we use this to draw metrics and to be able

06:16
to see it.

06:18
So we've got a couple of different metrics here that

06:20
we can look at in terms of numbers first. First

06:22
couple of metrics we have are pretty self explanatory.

06:24
We've got total prospect, total contacted, total conversating, total complete,

06:29
and total ghosted.

06:30
These

06:31
are based on all of the metrics you put into

06:33
here which is another reason that it's super important to

06:36
actually update this as you kind of go through.

06:39
The second thing we've got here is overall replies, positive

06:43
replies, neutral replies, and negative replies. This is obviously based

06:46
on the column over here which is the reply sentiment

06:49
of them replying back to you. And then we've got

06:51
total added to CRM,

06:53
average priority level, average alignment with niche, average strength of

06:57
connection, average decision making power, and average access to network.

07:01
This will give you insights into your lead list which

07:04
we're also going to pull over in graphs over here

07:06
so we can actually visualize that a bit more. And

07:08
then we've got our response rate, positive reply rate, conversation

07:11
rate, and time to first contact.

07:14
These get filled out as you input your numbers into

07:16
the first sheet.

07:18
Down here, we've also got missing CRM entries.

07:21
So if you populate, as we looked over here, we've

07:24
completed Nikolai with a positive reply, meaning you should have

07:27
been added into the CRM.

07:29
However, we haven't checked the box, meaning we haven't added

07:32
him, which then is gonna tell us, oh, you've missed

07:34
someone because this is very very important. Once they reply,

07:38
we need them in the Trello board so we can

07:40
follow-up with them. So if you haven't added them but

07:42
they are at the stage where you should add them,

07:44
it's going to tell you here. You can go through,

07:46
find the person, you tick this off, and in this

07:49
case, this will go down to 2 automatically.

07:52
These are all dynamic and you won't have to touch

07:54
anything. You just have to understand what the different things

07:57
are.

07:59
And over here, as you can see, we've got a

08:00
couple of different graphs to visualize our progress, visualize what's

08:03
happening within our boards. So number 1 here is just

08:07
the total prospects we have in our lead list versus

08:09
the total prospects we've contacted.

08:11
In this 1, you've got the different stages of contacted.

08:14
In this case, you can see how many goals to

08:17
do, how many you're conversating with, and how many you

08:19
have completed.

08:20
As well as over here, it's a bit of a

08:21
graph combining everything together which is stage insights. So how

08:25
many prospects do you have? How many prospects have you

08:27
contacted? How many of your overall prospects are you conversating

08:30
with? How many have you completed? How many have ghosted

08:32
you? And then over here, we've got some reply sentiments.

08:35
How many positively reply? How many negatively reply? And how

08:38
many neutral replies do you get overall throughout all the

08:40
leads you filled out this far.

08:43
Here we've got the lead list quality insights which is

08:46
essentially your network and giving you a bit of an

08:48
insight to what the average list quality is like. Are

08:52
they high on the priority level? Are they low on

08:54
the priority level? Etcetera.

08:56
This is set to 10. So based on what you

08:58
fill in, you will see a scale from 1 to

09:01
10 on how good your lead list quality is depending

09:04
on the different columns down here. Which you can see,

09:07
the network in my list is not necessarily the greatest.

09:10
However,

09:11
overall the alignment with niche is quite good. So this

09:15
gives us insights into our lead list.

09:18
Last thing over here is another way of visualizing

09:20
our overall leads insights which gives us insights to average

09:24
access to network, average alignment with niche.

09:28
And then lastly, a couple of different insights we have

09:30
on the bottom here is we've got insights into what

09:34
platforms

09:35
dominate in our lead list, where do we have the

09:37
most

09:38
prospects to contact. In this case, mine is emails.

09:42
You get them divided here into percentages

09:44
and pieces of this pie. So you can visualize how

09:48
many is here on email, how many is on LinkedIn,

09:50
how many is on Instagram, how many is on Facebook,

09:52
etcetera.

09:52
And then we've got lead insights into the roles.

09:56
How many are founders? How many are directors? How many

09:58
are co founders? How many are CEOs etcetera?

10:01
As well as what kind of industry are people in.

10:04
Do you have a lot of SaaS industries in your

10:06
list? Do you have a lot of marketing industries in

10:08
your list etcetera?

10:09
And this is all aimed towards helping you understand

10:13
what you have in your lead list to work off

10:15
of as well as insights on how good you are

10:17
performing.

10:18
Now let's jump back into the document. Then we've got

10:21
the deal pipeline board.

10:23
This is a Trello board that is your visual system

10:27
for tracking interested leads through your sales process. So when

10:31
you're doing warm outreach, you're gonna get 2 types of

10:34
responses. You're gonna get people who aren't interested and and

10:38
you're gonna get people who show some type of interest.

10:42
These interested leads

10:44
are potential

10:45
clients,

10:47
but they need a different type of handling than regular

10:49
outreach.

10:51
You don't want to lose track of someone who might

10:53
become a client

10:55
just because they got mixed up with hundreds of other

10:58
contacts

10:58
in your spreadsheets,

11:00
meaning in your warm outreach tracker. So the idea with

11:03
having this Trello board, the deal pipeline board, is that

11:07
you get to take the people who reply as interested

11:10
and put them into their own isolated table where you

11:14
can visualize who is at what stage and keep them

11:17
really isolated so you can give them the time and

11:19
care that they need to actually be converted into a

11:22
client.

11:23
So we're taking them from the warm outreach tracking spreadsheet

11:28
into this Trello board so we isolate them and keep

11:31
track so we don't lose anyone through the cracks.

11:34
So how do we set up this? Right? Setting up

11:36
a Trello board is number 1, open the template,

11:38
attach below the video exactly as the warm outreach tracker,

11:42
click

11:43
use templates, and then you're gonna be prompted to create

11:46
or log in to a free Trello account, and then

11:49
you can customize the column names if needed. I'm gonna

11:52
explain what the columns are in just a second. First,

11:56
I wanna explain why it benefits you.

11:59
It gives you a clear visual overview of your sales

12:02
pipeline. It can track the interested leads separately from your

12:05
other contacts. You never lose track of potential clients and

12:07
you can monitor the progress of each leads through the

12:10
sales process.

12:11
In 1 word, it's isolation.

12:14
So how this works is that there's gonna be different

12:16
columns.

12:17
Each column

12:18
represents a stage in your pipeline. You're gonna see all

12:22
of this pop up as soon as you copy over

12:23
the templates.

12:24
You're gonna get people who are interested which is column

12:27
number 1, which means

12:29
these are the people that have positively

12:32
responded to your outreach.

12:33
Then there's a column called no reply and an apprentices

12:36
follow-up.

12:38
Those are the people that missed the meeting or stopped

12:41
responding to your messages

12:43
after that initial positive reply. And then there's a column

12:46
called meeting schedule, which is your first call with them

12:49
is booked.

12:50
And then there is a second column called follow-up meeting

12:53
scheduled, which is that the second call is booked.

12:57
And then there is a column called proposal delivered, which

13:00
is you've sent them your offer. And then there is

13:03
a 1 section for the people that have become clients.

13:08
And a bit of a pro tip on this is

13:10
that you should check your Trello board right after your

13:13
morning outreach to make sure you're on top of all

13:17
your active opportunities.

13:18
And if you're confused about what morning outreach is, we're

13:22
gonna get into that in the coming videos. Okay. Now

13:24
let's hop into the Trello board quickly and have a

13:26
look at what it actually looks like. Here's a look

13:29
into what the Trello board looks like and how you

13:32
use it. Obviously, we've got all of the different cards

13:35
over here which are labeled the correct thing already. Now

13:39
in the document, I'm about to explain that you can

13:41
go through and you can change the card titles according

13:44
to your sales process. So if your sales process is

13:47
different from what we've listed out here, you can go

13:50
through, you just double click and you change them. So

13:53
So let's pretend that you have a stage where you

13:55
have 3 meetings.

13:56
Instead of this, you could go through, add another card,

13:59
your meeting 3, you add list, and you just drag

14:02
it over here, and then you put it into here.

14:06
If you just want to change the name to suit

14:08
your sales process better,

14:10
you could do proposal meeting and that's it. Change these

14:13
according to what you're actually looking to achieve here unless

14:16
it's the same and this is the standard. As you

14:19
can see, there's interested which is where leads are gonna

14:21
end up

14:22
when you put them in here first. You're gonna put

14:25
their names. I'm gonna put the first name here,

14:29
to start off with.

14:31
I'm gonna open the card, and I'm gonna put the

14:33
information in about the prospect. I'm gonna put his

14:38
contact information in here where our contact determined initially. I'm

14:41
gonna put any additional information about this.

14:43
Interested in a demo

14:46
of our SaaS

14:48
platform.

14:51
And then I'm going to do

14:54
next step

14:55
meeting.

14:56
And then I have all this information in here. I'm

14:58
gonna reach out to Nikolai. I'm gonna make sure to

15:00
try to get him on a meeting. Once he agrees

15:02
to the meeting, I'm gonna do meeting booked. I'm gonna

15:04
have the conversation with Nikolai.

15:05
He's gonna be really happy and really excited

15:08
about what we've done. So I'm going to rename this

15:11
back to what it was initially called, which is follow-up

15:14
meeting

15:15
booked.

15:16
And then once we've had our first meeting, Nikolai agrees

15:18
to have a follow-up meeting where we can give him

15:20
some additional information and maybe have a look into the

15:23
platforms he's using to see if this is suitable for

15:25
him. So we've booked the follow-up meeting with Nikolai, which

15:28
means we're gonna put him in here. We have a

15:30
follow-up meeting on Tuesday.

15:32
And on Tuesday, Nikolai says this looks all great. Could

15:36
you please send me a proposal on this? I'm gonna

15:38
go I'm gonna cook up the proposal. I'm gonna put

15:40
everything together, send it to Nikolai. Then I'm gonna put

15:43
him in proposal delivered. Now when Nikolai responds back to

15:47
me, I'm gonna either put him in won or lost.

15:49
And if he does not reply, I'm gonna put him

15:51
in contact again until he replies and gives me an

15:54
answer. Once I figure out if he pays or if

15:56
he doesn't pay, I'm gonna put him into either lost

15:59
or won. And that's how you use the Trello board.

16:02
Let's jump back into the document.

16:04
Now that you know how to use and how the

16:07
warm outreach tracking system works and the Trello board, I

16:10
want to explain how these systems work together just as

16:13
a bit of a summary. So you're gonna use the

16:15
warm outreach tracker for managing

16:18
all initial contacts

16:20
and your outreach.

16:22
And then you're gonna move the interested leads to the

16:26
deal pipeline board and track them through the sales process.

16:30
So all of the people you scrape, which we're gonna

16:32
do in just a second in this video here, they're

16:35
gonna be put into the warm outreach tracker. Then you

16:37
reach out to them, you try to conversate with them,

16:39
you contact them, etcetera. And as soon as they positively

16:41
reply, you move a deal pipeline board.

16:44
This prevents potential clients from getting lost in your contact

16:47
database.

16:48
Together, these tools give you a complete view of your

16:51
outreach efforts. These are 2 tools I would highly recommend

16:54
to just bookmark because you're gonna be using them every

16:57
single day. Now strategy for identifying warm contacts. If you

17:02
don't already know why we scrape contacts

17:05
and focus on this, make sure to go back and

17:08
watch the outreach theory video. Let's go through each platform

17:12
and how to scrape warm contacts effectively

17:15
for each 1 of them. So first of all, where

17:18
to look? On emails, you wanna go to your sent

17:21
folder

17:22
and look for potential

17:23
warm leads. Meaning people you've had a conversation with before,

17:26
if you sent an email, it's gonna be a lot

17:28
less than received. So I'll go through the sent folder.

17:30
Phone contact, you're simply gonna go through your phone contacts.

17:33
Not rocket science on that 1. And then we've got

17:36
LinkedIn which is you're gonna scan your connection for potential

17:39
leads. Instagram is you're gonna review your followers

17:42
and the people you follow.

17:44
And then Facebook, you're gonna check your friend list and

17:48
relevant groups you might be in. So scraping your warm

17:51
contacts.

17:53
Contact scraping is the process of extracting

17:56
contact information

17:57
from various sources.

17:59
Let's go through each platform and how to scrape warm

18:02
contacts efficiently. To scrape email, we're gonna go to takeout

18:07
dot Google dot com, which is an official Google service

18:11
or you could just open this link.

18:13
You're gonna scroll down to the section that says manage

18:15
exports.

18:17
You're gonna click create new export.

18:20
You're gonna scroll down to the checkbox that says mail.

18:23
You're gonna click all mail data, and then you're gonna

18:27
click sent.

18:28
And then you're gonna click next, create export. Then you're

18:31
gonna go through the contacts and add them to your

18:34
warm outreach tracker. Now do keep in mind that this

18:36
is a 24 to 48 hour process depending on how

18:40
many emails you have until you actually get to download

18:42
this. So you can do all the other things in

18:44
the meantime if you have a lot. Otherwise, it's also

18:47
very simple to go through and read your sent folder

18:50
and the people you've been mailing before.

18:52
And then we've got phone contacts, which is manual

18:55
labor.

18:57
I hate to say it, but

18:59
you're gonna open your phone contacts app. You're You're gonna

19:01
go through the contacts and add the relevant contacts to

19:04
your warm outreach tracker. That's it. Not rocket science. Then

19:07
LinkedIn is also manual labor. And the reason for this

19:11
is that LinkedIn is really, really strict on a lot

19:13
of these automations tools, all these fancy things. If I

19:17
were to do this personally,

19:18
I would 100 percent scroll through my connections manually and

19:21
input all the relevant ones.

19:24
And because that's what I would do, I'm not gonna

19:26
suggest you guys use some tool that has the chance

19:29
of getting you guys banned

19:31
which is why it's manual labor in this case. If

19:34
you really want to, you could go online and see

19:36
if you can find some tools to do this. An

19:38
educated guess is that there probably will be tools that

19:42
do it, but be really, really careful because it's extremely

19:45
easy to get banned off LinkedIn.

19:47
What you're gonna do is you're gonna log in to

19:49
LinkedIn, you're gonna click your profile picture and go to

19:51
your profile, you're gonna click the blue connection button to

19:55
see all your contacts, and then you're gonna go through

19:57
them, find the relevant ones, and put them into your

19:59
warm outreach tracker. And for Instagram,

20:02
we get to use the tool again. So Phantom Busters

20:05
Instagram follower collector.

20:08
Phantom Buster is a platform that has a ton of

20:11
different features, 1 of them being an Instagram follower collector.

20:15
So you're gonna go create an account with phantom buster

20:18
dot com,

20:19
go to the section that says Instagram follower collector,

20:23
you're gonna click use this phantom,

20:26
you're gonna connect your Instagram account and enter your targeted

20:29
profile,

20:30
which is your profile,

20:33
and then you're going to launch the Phantom and download

20:36
the results.

20:36
You're going to review the file for all relevant contacts

20:39
and you're going to go through and add them to

20:41
your warm outreach tracker.

20:44
And lastly, we've got Facebook. So Facebook, there's a Chrome

20:47
extension called Facebook friend exporter. There's a link here. Once

20:50
you click this link, you're gonna be taken to a

20:53
section that has a video explaining how it works and

20:55
how to use it.

20:57
You're gonna watch that and you're gonna follow it. Then

20:59
you're gonna fill in the details they need. You're gonna

21:02
download your contacts and you're gonna go through them and

21:04
put them into your warm contacts document once again.

21:08
And this is how they look. Obviously, you've seen this

21:11
already. And then prioritizing

21:12
your contacts. Prioritization

21:14
is deciding

21:15
what's most important to do first.

21:18
Contact prioritization

21:19
is picking which people to reach out to first and

21:22
report

21:23
is how well you know someone. So 1 of the

21:25
most important aspects of effective warm outreach is knowing which

21:29
contacts to focus on. This helps you direct your outreach

21:33
efforts

21:34
towards the most promising leads, maximizing your efficiency and success

21:38
rate.

21:39
To make the most of your warm contacts, prioritize them

21:42
based on their potential value for your triple a business.

21:46
There is a prioritization

21:48
hierarchy that we want to follow.

21:51
Number 1 is niche alignment.

21:54
How well do they fit your target market if you

21:57
have 1? Number 2 is connection strength.

22:00
How well do you know the warm contact? Number 3

22:03
is decision making power. How much authority they have to

22:07
make buying decisions?

22:09
And last 1 is network access. How valuable is their

22:12
network referrals?

22:14
In the contact management spreadsheets, you've got a section that

22:18
we've talked about earlier.

22:19
These 4 questions are put into here. So all you

22:22
need to do is go through as we've already talked

22:25
about and select a number for each 1 of them.

22:28
So you don't need to worry too much about it

22:30
but I want you to understand why we're doing it

22:32
and what we're actually answering in each 1 of the

22:34
columns in the spreadsheet. Before we move on to the

22:37
next video, let's recap the key concepts we've covered and

22:41
outline some actionable steps you can take to start building

22:44
and leveraging your warm network. Number 1 is your network

22:49
is your net worth in the triple a business. Number

22:51

is warm contacts are people with whom you have pre

22:55

23:10
to use. Now you might have some niche specific or

23:13
industry specific or life specific platforms

23:16
that you've been using.

23:17
Maybe you're in a bunch of Slack communities

23:19
instead of Facebook groups. You want to look at your

23:22
position and think, is there anything else I could do

23:24
outside of these mandatory ones?

23:31
and tracking progress.
