Right. Welcome to today's module on client closing winning formula.

00:04
Bit of a mouthful, I know. But, before we can

00:07
break down into the winning formula, we need to break

00:09
down, first of all, the basics of presentability

00:12
before we even get on the call. So look, presentability,

00:15
it goes a long way.

00:17
It's our first form of validation,

00:19
conviction, persuasion,

00:20
all before we start yapping away. First impressions, they are

00:24
important. Let's make the most of them. Think logically about

00:27
this. Is my mic okay? Is my camera okay? You

00:29
can get away with most mics and cameras on computers

00:32
these days. If your camera is really that bad, then

00:35
you might need to buy a webcam. Same with your

00:37
mic. But please don't think you need a big Rode

00:40
or Shure SM7B

00:41
or whatever it may be.

00:43
Trust me, I get away with my MacBook all the

00:45
time because it's good enough as is.

00:49
Sort of your background, it can be a great ice

00:50
breaker a great ice breaker as well.

00:53
So some of you will know if you've been to

00:55
my,

00:56
different

00:57
workshops or my coaching calls that I have a sequence

00:59
of art usually behind me. 1 of them being a

01:01
baby that sticks out of the wall. It's really weird

01:04
but it's a it's a great ice breaker and obviously

01:06
can be the same for you to do ice breaker

01:08
with your prospect on the other side of the computer.

01:11
And then dress like a niche which is a form

01:13
of mirroring. So obviously I'm not dressed

01:16
extremely

01:17
smart, you know, business wise it's a lot more casual

01:20
but what I'm saying is if your niche is,

01:23
finance,

01:24
or your niche is banking or whatever it may be,

01:27
you're not gonna dress in a hoodie or a t

01:28
shirt. You're going to put a business shirt on. And

01:31
if your niche is tradies,

01:33
you're probably gonna hurt yourself if you do dress too

01:36
businessy and have a tie on and you just look

01:38
like a bit of a dork. Right? So dressing like

01:40
a niche is quite important because it just shows that,

01:43
hey look, I understand

01:45
what it's like to be in the game where you

01:46
are. You know, we we dress alike. We understand each

01:49
other. It's just a bit of a sales technique and

01:51
similar to something we call mirroring.

01:55
Then we do the final checks before we do hop

01:57
on a call which is

01:58
make sure our clear voice and sound quality is okay,

02:01
avoiding any sort of background noise, making sure your computer

02:04
is charged. There's nothing worse than getting to the closing

02:06
stages or taking credit card details or sending payment links

02:09
and then all of a sudden,

02:11
oh shit. My computer just died.

02:13
Don't forget to record the call whether it be on

02:15
your phone or on Zoom or whatever you feel comfortable

02:18
with. This is gonna let you look back on how

02:21
you went,

02:22
if you could have made any improvements, if you could

02:24
handle objections better. Of course, you can feel free to

02:26
send those through to the sales coaches like myself on

02:29
the accelerator and of course, we can give you direct

02:31
feedback on that as well which can be super, super

02:33
helpful.

02:34
Next is have your notes open and be ready to

02:36
take notes. You wanna refer to them later in the

02:38
call. Trust me. I don't like to take notes on

02:40
my computer because it seems like I could be doing

02:42
literally anything else. I prefer to have a notepad a

02:45
notepad and a pen in my hand. It gives me

02:47
something to do with my hand. But also, it allows

02:49
me to take a bit of a breather and just

02:51
look away from the screen because sometimes it can get

02:53
quite a lot especially when you're on 8 calls a

02:56
day in an hour each. Now that's, that's pretty hectic.

03:00
Next up, embody the future you. This is more of

03:02
a confidence thing but think how would you take the

03:04
sales call if you were already making a hundred k

03:07
a month or whatever else it may be? People need

03:09
your service and they want what you have to offer

03:11
already.

03:12
You are solving a problem for them and they want

03:14
your help for that. Detach yourself from the outcome of

03:16
the call, focus on solving your problem, and I promise

03:19
you your prospect will pay you for that.

03:22
So client closing framework. Let's start with the discovery call.

03:26
First up, we're gonna start with an introduction and building

03:28
a report. This is really important. Then we're gonna take

03:31
control, set intention for the rest of the call. We're

03:33
gonna inject problem, pain point, and truth serum.

03:36
We're gonna uncover hell, start to peek it away which

03:38
is the current situation and start to peek away the

03:41
desired situation which is the heaven as well. And that's

03:44
it. That's the entire discovery call broken down into 5

03:48
different,

03:49
I guess, vertebrae in your backbone if you wanna call

03:51
it that. Remember, discover a call 10, 15, 20 minutes

03:54
long. It doesn't have to be anything nuts. So let's

03:57
start with, introducing ourselves and building a rapport. This is

04:00
the start of a call. A couple of minutes of

04:02
actual friendly conversation here is completely fine. Things like, hey,

04:05
how are you going today, Leon? Where are you calling

04:07
from today?

04:08
This is just a warm up for conversation and hopefully

04:11
you make a good first impression. This stage of the

04:13
call can secure you a lot of respect and it

04:16
can really help increase your conversion rates too. So it's

04:19
cool if you do well in this part, if you

04:20
don't, it's not really gonna hurt you so, it's, you

04:23
know, best to make the most of it.

04:25
Think about how you would chat with your uncle or

04:27
auntie as well. So we're not chatting with, you know,

04:29
our boys or our girls or anything like that. You're

04:31
not chatting with your dad even. If you're chatting, think

04:34
about it like you're chatting with your uncle and auntie.

04:35
Obviously, everyone's got a different relationship with their uncle and

04:37
auntie but this is usually a good way of coming

04:39
about it. Think who like how am I gonna chat

04:41
with a relative? I kind of know, don't know heaps

04:44
about at a Christmas function or a family dinner or

04:47
something like that. Keep conversation light, you know, light hearted

04:50
and and enjoyable and, you know, peak interest,

04:53
and I guess go along those lines. That should help

04:56
you obviously build a bit of, confidence when you're speaking

04:59
to these different people but also,

05:01
you know, help you with your flow a little bit.

05:03
So that's introduction and building rapport.

05:05
Next up, we cover taking control and setting intention. Now

05:08
this part is really important. Now we're gonna bring some

05:10
authority into the call and take control and get underway.

05:13
Hey. So, Liam, obviously, we're scheduled here for the next

05:15
15 minutes. I wanna do all I can to provide

05:18
you as much value and knowledge in that short amount

05:20
of time. So with that being said, do you mind

05:22
if we do get underway? Absolutely. Okay. So now we're

05:25
taking control in starting the problem solving exercise.

05:27
So Liam, the point of this call is for me

05:30
to ask you some questions, learn more about yourself and

05:32
your business. That'll give me a really good indication as

05:35
to how I may be able to provide you any

05:37
value and help you solve any sort of problems. With

05:40
that being said Liam, and this is where we inject

05:42
problem pain point truth serum, this is where we really

05:44
get into it, guys. So you need to understand their

05:46
reason for joining the call.

05:48
There's obviously a problem that they need help with and

05:50
usually know what that problem is that you need to

05:52
fix, but the solution

05:55
and to their general problem

05:57
isn't enough. You need to have a solution to their

05:59
specific problem which is why we need to ask them

06:01
questions. So with that being said Liam,

06:03
what motivated you to join me on today's call? What

06:05
problems are we trying to solve? Okay. How long have

06:08
you been dealing with this problem?

06:10
Awesome.

06:11
Why do you think you are dealing with this problem?

06:12
We're gonna start, you know, injecting pain point treat serum,

06:15
understanding their situation a little bit more like that doctor

06:18
to the patient. Just understand a bit of the context.

06:21
Right? You know, why are you having headaches? Why are

06:22
you feeling light headed? Whatever it may be. What have

06:24
you tried? Etcetera, etcetera.

06:27
Here we're going to label. Labeling is really, really important.

06:29
You'll see me do this a lot on my workshops

06:32
or if you, see if you see any of my

06:34
recorder calls, I'll literally go like this in the air.

06:37
I'll go bang like that. And what I'm doing is

06:39
I'm picking up a figurative stamp,

06:41
with their problem labeled on it and I am jamming

06:44
it into their forehead with a big red marker that

06:46
says, you know, whatever their problem is, conviction or,

06:50
conversion rates or whatever it may be. Labeling is a

06:53
really strong sales tactic that we do to essentially make

06:56
the prospects not be able to run away from their

06:58
problems. That's the last thing we want. We wanna show

07:00
them that, hey. This is the problem you've admitted to.

07:02
This is the problem that I've labeled you with, and

07:04
now we're figuring out how we can solve this problem.

07:07
Now Now we're starting to uncover hell and peeping that

07:09
curtain away a little bit which is their current situation.

07:12
So in order for us to properly guide the conversation

07:15
and, of course, eventually make them an offer they can't

07:17
refuse, we need to understand their current situation

07:19
perfectly.

07:20
So we're going to ask questions like, okay, how are

07:22
you getting new customers? If I'm asking sales wise, I'm

07:24
going to think, how are you getting new customers? What

07:26
does your cost per new customer look like? I like

07:28
to repeat their answers back to them to really get

07:31
a confirmation of what their issues are

07:33
and of course, then it's a bit of a mirroring

07:35
effect. It shows that I understand what they're saying, and

07:38
I'm following along the right lines.

07:40
Okay. So from what you told me, your main bottleneck

07:42
in your business at the moment, Liam, is definitely finding

07:44
new customers and that's what's stopping you from growing past

07:47
25 k in monthly revenue. Is that about right? Yeah,

07:49
it is. Great.

07:51
So uncovering hell, pretty simple. Defining hell is important for

07:54
illustrating to the prospect how serious their problem can be

07:57
if it's left unsolved.

07:59
Whatever you give as their current situation

08:01
or whatever they give, sorry, we just need to amplify

08:04
it. You don't need to be rude, don't be a

08:06
dick, but you need to amplify and empathize with them

08:09
as well. So if they're dealing with

08:12
they're dealing with low conversion rates, I'm gonna go low

08:15
conversion rates. Right. Okay. How long have you been dealing

08:17
with that, Liam? Honestly, it's been the last, honestly, last

08:20
month or 2 which has been, you know, pretty bad.

08:22
Month or 2. Wow. That is pretty harmful,

08:25
obviously to to your numbers. Right?

08:28
Have you tried anything that in that whole month or

08:30
2?

08:31
Honestly, we tried we tried this this agency. It just

08:34
didn't really work. Yeah. Right. Why why didn't it work?

08:36
What did they do that you felt, you know, wasn't

08:39
wasn't the right fit for you guys? And, you know,

08:41
what would you do differently

08:43
in order to work with an agency, engaging agency that

08:46
would work better for you guys? What would that look

08:47
like? Etcetera, etcetera, right? We're uncovering the current situation and

08:50
we're digging deep.

08:52
Yeah, Liam, I can see how that could slow down

08:54
your business. I hear you not being able to acquire

08:56
customers when you really want really hinders your growth. You

08:58
know, empathizing in a way but making it amplified.

09:01
Make their problem sound very bad and gather the data

09:04
that you will use to close the deal later in

09:06
the call.

09:08
Now uncovering heaven.

09:09
After understanding your current situation and pain points, we need

09:12
to understand what they actually want. What is it they

09:15
want to achieve and we have to sell the vacation

09:17
here.

09:18
What's the goal for you in the next year with

09:20
your business, Liam? Why does that motivate you? What is

09:23
your motivation behind getting to this, getting to where you

09:26
think you could be? You know, what does that mean

09:28
for you personally? What does it mean for you professionally?

09:31
You wanna be focusing on the benefits of the desired

09:33
situation rather than just the features of it. So the

09:36
benefits would be location freedom, time freedom, leave, their 9

09:40
to 5, travel, whatever it might be. Whereas the features,

09:43
they're just a 15 percent increase in conversion rates or

09:47
3 to 5 hours a day per week, whatever it

09:49
might be. Nothing special. So you'll see here it says

09:51
sell the vacation and that's all you're doing. Think of

09:53
an airline company, they're not selling you tickets based on,

09:56
oh, our seats are 10 percent bigger than all our

09:58
competitors.

09:59
We'll let you pick pick your seats for free whereas

10:02
other competitors charge you 5 bucks or whatever it may

10:04
be. And, you know, our our carbon efficiency, no 1

10:07
cares. Right? You're not buying a plane ticket

10:10
because it's an awesome plane and you can't wait to

10:12
sit in a in a cubicle

10:14
next to different people for hours on end. No. You're

10:18
buying that plane ticket so you can go to Hawaii

10:20
and that's exactly what they're selling you on. Right? They're

10:22
selling you on the vacation. They're talking about how amazing

10:25
Hawaii is this time of year. How the how the

10:28
sand feels in between your toes. The different, things you

10:31
can see, the different scuba diving spots in Hawaii etcetera,

10:34
etcetera, right? That's the stuff that sells. The act of

10:37
having to get to that point doesn't, right? Because that's

10:40
difficult. Same thing here. It's difficult to achieve location freedom

10:43
but that's what sells. We're not selling them on a

10:45
15 percent increase in conversions.

10:48
And that's it. Seems pretty easy. Right? That's an entire

10:51
discovery call done just like that. Remember, discovery call is

10:54
10, 15, 20 minutes long. It's nothing crazy. So you

10:57
don't need to worry so much

10:59
about going through too much of a process. Remember, there

11:02
is no script. It's just a framework. We're just gathering

11:05
information and qualifying or disqualifying. That's the main thing. Can

11:09
I help them? Is my is my service good for

11:11
them? Etcetera, etcetera. Thanks, guys. I'll see you in the

11:13
next module.
