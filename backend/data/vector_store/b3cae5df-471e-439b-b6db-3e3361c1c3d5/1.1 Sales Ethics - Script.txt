Welcome to the sales section of this course. In this

00:03
module, we're gonna talk about what exactly is sales and

00:06
a brief introduction into sales ethics and why it's important.

00:10
So what exactly is sales?

00:12
Sales is essentially a problem solving exercise in which we

00:15
help our prospects to make the most informed and best

00:17
decision possible.

00:19
That's it. All sales is is helping our prospect to

00:22
make the best and most informed decision possible.

00:25
And the best and most informed decision possible

00:27
should be your service or product. If it's not,

00:30
stop right here and go fix your offer because otherwise

00:34
we're not going to see the sort of success we're

00:35
actually hoping for. But what would the reason our offer

00:38
isn't the best solution for our prospect be?

00:41
Usually, it's either our offer doesn't actually solve any pain

00:44
points or problems for our prospects

00:46
or our offer does solve pain points or problems for

00:48
our prospect but in the process creates more problems negating

00:52
any sort of positive

00:54
effect. So before we go any further, ask yourself these

00:57
3 questions.

00:58
What problems or pain points does my offer solve for

01:01
my ICP, my ideal client persona?

01:03
Does that problem or pain point warrant actually doing anything

01:06
about for my ICP?

01:07
And is my offer the best solution to the problems

01:10
or pain points that my ICP is facing?

01:12
We're hoping to bring on a client here, hoping to

01:14
start a business relationship. We're not here to sign up

01:17
anybody and just take their money regardless if we can

01:19
help them or not. That's called scamming and scammers are

01:22
dweebs.

01:23
Don't be a dweeb.

01:25
1 time sales tactics, they don't work here and you

01:27
need to be more focused on solving problems rather than

01:29
earning a sale. If you've ever been to 1 of

01:31
my workshops or you've had 1 on 1 coaching with

01:33
me, you've probably heard me say providing value rather than

01:37
signing a client and it's because it's gospel.

01:39
Providing value rather than signing a client

01:42
will allow you to do bits in business as opposed

01:45
to the other way around.

01:47
Let me show you why. So here's an example of

01:50
2 guys. 1 guy called Steve and 1 guy called

01:52
James. Steve and James, they both start their triple a

01:54
around the same time and they both had a lot

01:56
of real world experience within the real estate niche. Consequently,

02:00
they've both decided to pick this niche

02:02
as their niche for their triple a. They understand the

02:05
market, they understand the common pain points and problems, and

02:07
they think they can help aid or even solve these

02:09
problems altogether.

02:10
So Steve and James, they go on their merry way

02:12
creating their new business websites, their contracts, their softwares, etcetera,

02:16
etcetera.

02:17
Awesome. Both Steve and James have had just had their

02:20
first 5 clients booked into their calendar for the next

02:22
week.

02:23
Let's start with Steve. So Steve gets on his calls

02:26
and realizes that only 1 of his 5 sales leads

02:28
is actually qualified, meaning he can actually help them in

02:31
the first

02:32
place. Steve, however, thinks who am I to stop someone

02:34
from signing up for my business and

02:37
making the decision to pay me for my service.

02:39
So in that week, Steve signs 3 clients, 1 of

02:43
which is qualified and 2 of which are not qualified,

02:45
meaning Steve can't really help them. In the next month,

02:48
Steve's qualified client sees awesome results.

02:51
Safe to say he's a real happy champion. But Steve's

02:54
other 2 clients,

02:55
well, they couldn't be further from satisfied.

02:58
They've both individually spent about 2 and a half grand

03:00
on a service that has really shown no results and

03:02
only caused more headaches

03:04
and as a result, these 2 unsatisfied clients, they just

03:07
leave terrible reviews. They tell their business network how unsatisfied

03:10
they are with Steve and his triple a and Steve

03:13
loses 2 clients.

03:14
Now, this goes on for the next 3 or 4

03:16
months or so until Steve has now completely tarnished his

03:19
name within the real estate sector. His agency reviews on

03:22
Trustpilot absolutely stink and his qualified clients see this and

03:26
decide they can be working with someone better and leave

03:29
them instead.

03:30
So let's talk about James now. James actually got his

03:33
first 5 sales leads booked into his calendar, same time

03:36
as Steve, and he gets on these calls and realized

03:38
that, hey, only 1 of these 5 leads is actually

03:41
qualified, meaning I can actually help him. So James actually

03:44
just signs the 1 client.

03:45
He does an awesome job for his client and in

03:47
the next month, the client couldn't be any happier with

03:50
James and his triple a. James' first client writes a

03:53
glowing testimonial and 3 or 4 months go on and

03:56
James is now a market leader within his niche. His

03:58
clients couldn't be happier with his work and frequently refer

04:01
him and his triple a to other networks.

04:03
James is now incredibly well known within his market.

04:06
James consequently

04:08
talks to a lot of prospects who have worked within

04:10
agencies previously

04:11
but haven't seen any sort of good results and instead

04:14
caused more turmoil for their business.

04:16
Or prospects who have seen decent results but have moved

04:19
away from previous agencies because of their poor reputation

04:23
within the market.

04:25
As such, James now signs these clients taking up even

04:28
more market share.

04:30
So now you see the importance of sales ethics and

04:33
providing real value to your clients rather than just signing

04:35
anyone up. You are thinking about the long game here,

04:38
not getting into business or triple a just to make

04:40
a couple bucks here and there. This is not the

04:43
right model for that specific circumstance.

04:45
If there's nothing else to take away from today's lesson,

04:48
it's this.

04:49
Your success is directly proportional to your client's success. Now,

04:53
what I mean by that is if your clients are

04:55
doing super, super well, your business will do super, super

04:57
well. If you treat your clients well, they'll treat you

05:00
you well.

05:01
If you dick around your clients and can't provide them

05:04
any sort of success, they're not gonna stick around with

05:06
you. They're gonna give you bad testimonials. You can have

05:08
a bad name and you're pretty much gonna burn that

05:10
entire niche and burn future niches as well.
