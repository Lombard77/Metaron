Now getting into the implementation challenge. In the previous section,

00:03
we explored the transformative benefits that AI automation offers businesses.

00:07
Yet despite these compelling advantages, most businesses haven't taken a

00:10
significant step towards adoption. Let me explain why and more

00:13
importantly, how you can help them to bridge this gap.

00:15
The current state of adoption. As we learned earlier in

00:17
our discussion on the technology adoption life cycle, businesses fall

00:20
into distinct categories in their approach to AI. The innovators

00:22
are these tech forward companies that are pioneering AI adoption

00:25
since 20 22. Well, this is generative AI but likely

00:28
a long time before that. They've gained a valuable early

00:31
advantage but weathered the challenges of unstable platforms and evolving

00:34
tools. Then you've got the early adopters who are the

00:36
forward thinking businesses actively seeking AI solutions now, ready to

00:39
invest but struggling to find reliable

00:41
implementation partners. We have the early majority which of course

00:44
is our biggest opportunity. Businesses that see AI's potential but

00:47
need proven success cases and clear implementation paths before committing.

00:50
And we have the late majority and laggards. Companies either

00:53
unaware of AI's potential or waiting until solutions become industry

00:56
standard before considering adoption. So we can break down this

00:59
market. The people we're really selling to are going to

01:00
be these these people here and we can break these

01:02
people down into a number of different segments even further.

01:05
That'll make it a lot clearer to who you're trying

01:07
to sell to and the problems that you need to

01:08
solve for them as an AI automation agency when you're

01:11
trying to present some value to them. So this spread

01:13
here in the market creates distinct segments based on their

01:16
needs and what we can offer them. So let's examine

01:19
each of these groups. Firstly, we have the unaware which

01:21
is the majority of people and businesses at the moment.

01:24
There are large portion of businesses that lack basic understanding

01:27
of AI capabilities and benefits. They need foundational education before

01:30
they can even consider implementation. The majority of businesses here

01:34
are gonna be

01:35
this this is 84

01:37
percent of the population and they are likely unaware of

01:40
AI and what it can really do and they just

01:42
need some kind of education to get them to be

01:45
aware of what AI can do for them and why

01:47
it's so important that they move on it. Then we

01:48
have the interested but uncertain. These are businesses that are

01:51
familiar with AI and heard about it. Maybe they're dipping

01:53
their toe in but they're unsure about where to start.

01:56
They need expert help to identify the high ROI opportunities

01:59
within their operations. Someone to tell them this is what

02:02
you should do. These are where the opportunities are for

02:04
you, and that's this interested segment. And then you have

02:06
the ready to implement. And those who understand the value

02:08
but need technical expertise to deliver their their solutions

02:11
effectively, they need development services and ongoing support.

02:14
So they are ready to go but they're just looking

02:16
for someone they can trust to help them get into

02:18
the AI game and and to build the systems that

02:20
they know they need. So understanding these segments helps us

02:22
see why businesses aren't all rushing to adopt AI right

02:25
now and reveals 4 key challenges that we need to

02:28
address in order to make money off them.

02:31
Firstly, we have the awareness gap. So most businesses simply

02:34
don't understand modern AI's capabilities

02:36
or how it could benefit them. They just don't have

02:38
the time or they're not necessarily techy. They're basically stuck

02:40
at the starting line needing some clear education about what

02:43
AI can realistically do today, how it creates business value,

02:46
the common implementation approaches, the typical results and time frames.

02:50
And this really represents our largest market opportunities as AI

02:53
automation agencies which is helping businesses to move from complete

02:56
unawareness

02:57
to understanding AI's potential for their specific situation. Agencies who

03:01
can effectively move businesses through this phase will profit greatly

03:04
at later stages. So we have this awareness gap here

03:07
where they aren't aware of what AI can do for

03:09
them. And we can move them from this segment to

03:11
this through products and services and convert them into someone

03:14
who's interested and then someone who's ready as we're gonna

03:16
see. And then we have the strategy gap. So even

03:18
businesses who understand the benefits of AI and are interested

03:21
in it often struggle with identifying the highest value opportunities,

03:25
prioritizing different possible implementations, building a realistic roadmap and finding

03:29
reliable technical partners. This creates demand for expert agencies to

03:32
guide their AI journey, helping them make informed decisions about

03:35
where and how to implement AI effectively the first time

03:38
around. What you need to keep in mind is that

03:40
these are often big spends for companies. They're having to

03:43
look, well we need to spend a lot of money

03:45
on this whole system that we run and have been

03:47
using for a long time and we need to upgrade

03:49
this to be AI first and to integrate AI into

03:51
it in some way. These are big decisions and while

03:54
some companies will kind of pilot and do small things

03:57
on the side, at some point they know they need

03:59
to attack some of these bigger issues. Other people in

04:01
their market are gonna likely be attacking it as well

04:04
and this is when they are aware that's why they're

04:05
not they don't have the awareness gap. They are aware

04:08
that they need to do something about this. But because

04:11
there's such a heavy investment, because there's such a technical

04:13
gap between where they are and where they where they

04:15
need to be in order to execute a roadmap effectively,

04:18
They are looking for someone to help them with as

04:19
a strategy and road mapping their AI journey. And then

04:22
next, we have the investment challenge which is when businesses

04:25
are ready to implement AI as in they've they've gone

04:28
through this and they've moved from interested to ready and

04:30
they know what they need and they're ready to go

04:31
and they're just looking for a team. They still face

04:33
significant financial considerations

04:35
which is upfront costs. We've got development, integration, and training

04:38
expenses that can range from 20 to a hundred thousand

04:41
dollars or more requiring careful budgeting and substantial initial investment.

04:44
They've when and how these investments will actually pay off

04:47
through

04:52
opportunity for agencies who can price competitively

04:55
while maintaining high quality development teams. And also in here,

04:58
very clearly communicating that you are the team for them

05:00
to work with. You are someone they can trust and

05:00
they can put that money in your hand and you

05:00
telling them that yes, they're someone they can trust and

05:02
they can put that money in your hand and you

05:04
telling them that yes, this is the right move for

05:06
you. They will get that ROI. It's a there's almost

05:08
a confidence layer in here as well that someone who

05:11
knows what they are talking about has told them that

05:13
this is what they should do. And that essentially does

05:15
come in a strategy gap. This is more so how

05:17
can we make it make sense for us financially within

05:19
a reasonable

05:20
return timeline. So through efficient delivery and really dialing in

05:23
your delivery processes and clear ROI planning for your clients,

05:26
payment plans and other methods, agencies can help make these

05:29
investments more manageable and believe that it's actually gonna deliver

05:32
on the results.

05:33
To demonstrate faster past and positive returns. So your past

05:36
work and and pointing out, hey we did this for

05:38
this. Ideally, if you're working in a space where you

05:40
are doing a similar project for other other clients, that's

05:43
gonna make it a lot easier for to make that

05:44
big investment. Right? And so the better the proof, the

05:47
bigger the investment and the more clear the ROI is

05:49
gonna be for them. And so this investment challenge, once

05:51
you can help them cross that by again having streamlined

05:54
processes for your agency, having the right talent for the

05:57
job, not overpaying for talent, and offering them competitive payment

05:59
plans so that they can actually make it make sense

06:01
over 6 months or so. You can help them move

06:03
from this ready to being actually AI enabled and actually

06:06
having implemented it within their business, which is where a

06:08
small group of businesses are right now. And the final

06:10
challenge that comes after that is the management, which is

06:13
even after successful implementation, businesses face ongoing operational concerns about

06:17
managing, maintaining, and optimizing their AI systems. So 1 option

06:20
is to have an internal capability.

06:22
Organizations struggle with whether to build internal AI expertise or

06:25
rely on external partners for long term management weighing factors

06:28
like cost, control and reliability. So this is an opportunity

06:31
for you whether or not you pitch your agency as

06:33
a long term partner. Look, it's gonna cost you all

06:35
this money to set it up internally. We wanna be

06:37
your go to AI team and we can help you

06:40
sort of grow and be a long term partner for

06:42
you. Or you can do on the flip side. Look

06:43
we've built this all out for you. But at the

06:45
end of the day, you're gonna need to have your

06:46
own AI internal capability. So I'll tell you what, we

06:49
also have this program for you which is gonna help

06:51
you to connect you with the right developers. We will

06:54
help to get them placed. You know, you can start

06:55
to create packages off the back of that where you

06:58
could even put 1 of your devs into the company

07:00
and say look we're gonna give you 1 of our

07:02
guys for 6 months or 3 months. There's all these

07:04
different ways that you can solve this because this is

07:06
just another problem that they're willing to pay for. We

07:08
either need it internally or we need a long term

07:10
partner that isn't gonna rip us off and we can

07:12
rely on. And that's not just for development, it's also

07:15
for strategy as well. A recurring strategy partner like, hey.

07:18
Okay. It's been a year now or it's been 2

07:20
quarters.

07:21
What's new and what should we be doing? These are

07:23
ongoing things that you can do as part of this

07:24
management challenge to monetize the demand. Secondly, we have the

07:27
system evolution. AI capabilities and best practices are constantly advancing

07:31
like I just said before, requiring ongoing updates and improvements

07:34
to maintain competitive advantage. Then we have performance optimization as

07:38
well. Certain systems need continuous monitoring and refinement to maintain

07:41
their peak performance and adapt to changing business conditions. Say

07:44
your ICP starts to shift and your AI sales rep

07:47
isn't performing at 5 or 6 percent anymore. It's down

07:49
to 2. They need to know that they have someone

07:51
there who can help them to, get that performing again.

07:53
So this management challenge creates opportunities for triple a's to

07:56
provide ongoing management services and help businesses build internal capabilities

08:00
over time. The key is understanding that AI implementation isn't

08:03
a 1 time project. It's the beginning of a long

08:06
term transformation that requires sustained attention

08:08
and expertise.

08:11
And a little bonus for you here is this human

08:13
factor. So 1 challenge that isn't talked about enough is

08:15
the human factor

08:17
inside businesses

08:18
managing the internal politics as you go through an AI

08:21
transformation. So successful implementation requires carefully managing organizational change. The

08:26
leadership needs to be brought in. Right? So the executives

08:28
must understand and support the transformation while maintaining strategic control.

08:32
Employee adoption. Staff need clear communication about how AI will

08:35
enhance rather than replace their roles. This is a massive

08:38
1 and the bigger the company you go into sort

08:40
of the slower moving. If you're in these digital spaces

08:42
like agencies

08:44
People are always kinda pretty open minded and ready to

08:46
do a I stuff because they're like, oh if it

08:48
makes my job easier and I can do more then

08:49
great. But as you get into big companies and you

08:52
get into companies that are in sort of more slower

08:54
moving industries. You're more and more likely to run into

08:57
people who are terrified of AI. They are they hate

09:00
the technology. They are absolutely hate it. Whether they're creative,

09:04
whether they are an engineer or something, but they just

09:06
despise it. And out of a hundred people, you're bound

09:09
to get 1 of those. We see this in our

09:11
consultancy

09:12
a lot. We've got a handful of bad eggs who

09:15
unfortunately need to be cut or they need to be

09:17
very carefully managed into the through the transition. There also

09:20
needs to be a pretty substantial culture shift within organizations

09:23
as they must evolve the processes and the mindset to

09:25
fully leverage AI capabilities. We need you to experiment. We

09:28
need you to give us the ideas that you have

09:30
so that we can sort of dig through them and

09:32
plan it. We provide strategy for our consulting clients on

09:35
how to get sort of this AI cultural shift and

09:37
sort of committees and things that you can set up

09:39
there. So this is a a bit of a broader

09:41
issue I'd say for, than the many of you starting

09:44
an agency you're gonna need to worry about. And I'll

09:46
likely cover this in a later, later course

09:49
that will go more in-depth in how we do these

09:51
kind of AI transformations of businesses particularly

09:53
on the the morning site consulting side. And so now

09:55
that you know these different segments and you know the

09:57
challenges that they're facing, we have the unaware, interested, and

10:00
ready, and the AI enabled,

10:02
and the awareness gap, the strategy gap, the investment challenge,

10:05
and the management challenge. We can get into the triple

10:08
a opportunity.

10:09
Now I know you've probably heard this a million billion

10:11
times in this course so far right now. But this

10:13
is how to monetize off of these different challenges. Right?

10:16
So each of these challenges represents an opportunity

10:18
for AI automation agencies to create value. In the next

10:21
section, we'll explore how to build effective solutions for each

10:24
market segment, helping businesses progress from wherever they are today

10:27
to successful AI implementation. So you've got the awareness gap

10:30
which is a need for education. You've got the strategy

10:32
gap which is a need for guidance. You've got the

10:35
investment challenge which is a need for affordable and capable

10:37
development partners. And then you've got the management challenge which

10:40
is the need for support or even expertise, ongoing expertise

10:43
could be put in there too. So educational products, guidance

10:46
and strategy and consulting relating products, development offers and development

10:49
services that are well priced and you have ongoing management

10:53
either placements as well. You can do things like that

10:55
like I said before. But these opportunities at each of

10:57
these levels, that's what I'm trying to make you aware

10:58
of now. It's not just build me x. It's some

11:02
of your clients that you're gonna run into will need

11:04
this. And it's a case of how do you prioritize

11:06
these as your agency. What is your strategy? Are you

11:08
gonna start with education? And I'm just gonna start with

11:10
a few small educational products for my niche. And I'm

11:13
gonna use that and get a bit of money and

11:14
then I'm gonna use that income to help me get

11:17
a developer or consultant on and then I'm gonna start

11:19
to expand my offering. But I wanna really reveal this

11:21
because many of you think that this model is only

11:23
this. But it's it's it's all of this as well.

11:25
And this is what I talked about a lot for

11:26
the expansion we're doing at Morningside and how we're seeing

11:29
a lot of success with the educational and consulting section

11:32
of of this, sort of demand spread we've got before

11:34
they get to this point. So by understanding these distinct

11:36
needs, we can create targeted offerings that address each stage

11:39
of their journey from basic education through consulting implementation and

11:43
ongoing support and optimization.

11:45
So the AI transformation journey. As we've seen, businesses need

11:48
different types of support depending on where they are in

11:50
the AI adoption journey. Success as a triple a means

11:53
being able to provide value at every stage of this

11:56
transformation process. Let's say at least

11:59
1 stage.

12:01
So you obviously got to start off and do 1

12:03
but it would be good if you can expand to

12:05
having multiple like we do at Morningside where we can

12:06
do from education all the way through to sort of

12:09
long term partnerships and and support. So the journey typically

12:11
unfolds across 4 key stages,

12:13
each requiring different types of support. So education tier is

12:16
building trust and awareness through free content like I do

12:19
on YouTube, workshops and basic assessments. So you can run

12:23
live workshops. You can run pre recorded workshops.

12:26
Basically, kind of free course content and you can do

12:28
basic assessments for free. This helps businesses to understand AI's

12:31
potential and starts positioning you as their trusted guide. Alright.

12:34
We are the people who can help you through this.

12:36
We understand your problems and concerns. Then the consulting tiers,

12:38
once they grasp the potential and they're ready to move

12:40
forward, say okay. Now we need to move on this.

12:42
You can offer paid strategic services like AI audits to

12:45
identify and plan the the AI implementation roadmap. This includes

12:48
auditing your operations and creating clear roadmaps for success. Then

12:51
we have the implementation tier which is when you have

12:53
a solid plan in place. You can then deliver development

12:55
and integration services that turn their AI vision that you

12:58
painted here and sort of prep them for up here

13:01
into a reality. You focus on creating systems that integrate

13:03
seamlessly with your operations starting with the quick wins using

13:06
the difficulty value matrix which we've covered already in this

13:09
program in order to build trust. And finally, the partnership

13:11
stair is providing ongoing management and optimization services to ensure

13:15
long term success. You can help them find talented AI

13:17
automation engineers to begin building their own internal AI innovation

13:21
engine and get paid big bucks. Here you can see

13:23
education tier, free content workshops, basic assessments, consulting tier, doing

13:27
the audits, helping them strategize, get the AI roadmap. You

13:29
got the implementation tier where you actually do the building

13:32
for them and picking out the sort of easiest quick

13:34
wins for them so that you can build even further

13:35
trust. Right? It's all really just a slow process of

13:38
trust building. In my example, they watch my YouTube videos.

13:41
They go, oh, well this guy kinda knows what he's

13:42
talking about. Oh, great. Yeah. I might I might subscribe

13:44
to his newsletter or something and they get on the

13:46
newsletter and they start to hear me talking more and

13:48
more and more about the AI business related things I

13:50
do. And they go, okay. Well, if he can do

13:51
it for his own business, then he can definitely do

13:53
it for me. So maybe I'll book an a call

13:55
with Morningside and I book on a call and my

13:57
team will recommend, hey, sounds like you're not quite ready

13:58
for implementation.

14:00
We have a 6 week strategy audit we can put

14:02
you through and then we'll close them on that. We

14:04
just close 1 for 60000 US dollars for a 4

14:07
week strategy audit and that was a massive win for

14:09
us recently within the consultancy division and we just closed

14:11
another 1 for 30000 or 35000

14:14
USD.

14:15
So that's a pretty massive set of deals for us

14:18
just on this particular bit alone. And that helps us

14:20
eventually to sell them on implementation as well for hundred

14:23
thousand, 500000

14:25
even. I suspect we're gonna be taking on million dollar

14:27
deals here within the next maybe 12 months. Because we

14:30
are prepping and building such a high amount of trust

14:32
in these previous phases, this is quite advanced strategy for

14:35
you all but I want you to know where you

14:36
can take this. It's not just 3000 dollar chat bots

14:39
guys. You should be able to expand to doing these

14:41
bigger and bigger deals and taking on much larger commitments

14:43
from clients as you build trust with them. And finally,

14:45
the partnership tier is where they might just come back

14:47
to you and say, hey, we wanted a couple changes

14:49
here and there and it's very easy retainers to do

14:51
at least if you like the client. So by structuring

14:53
our services this way, we can meet businesses wherever they

14:56
are in their journey and guide them towards successful AI

14:58
adoption. And I say here, as I said before, take

15:01
it easy. Right? To provide end to end AI transformation

15:03
is a big operation and I'm giving you this context

15:06
now so that you see the breadth of services we

15:08
can provide to create value for businesses to help them

15:10
to bridge that AI adoption gap. Some of you will

15:13
be great communicators, better suited to education and consulting. Some

15:16
will be devs who want to do the implementation.

15:18
But just pick 1 area first and nail it before

15:21
moving up or down the

15:22
pipeline. And there is another caveat to that which is

15:24
the best proof is going to come from implementation. Right?

15:27
I said morning side, we can do consulting and people

15:29
will pay us 60000 dollars for consulting because we do

15:32
this. Right? If you didn't do this, it would be

15:34
a lot harder to sell them on 60000 dollar consulting.

15:37
Right? And also the education stuff that I do for

15:39
free on YouTube also helps to provide credibility for this

15:42
and this as well. So it all kinda ties together.

15:44
But if you were to just start trying to do

15:45
consulting and you didn't necessarily have any proof, the only

15:48
way that you could get to actually make money through

15:50
AI consulting would be that that you'd done it for

15:53
free for a few people and you told them what

15:54
to do. You measure the results off the back of

15:56
that and they were like, well, this guy's obviously knows

15:58
what he's doing when it comes to AI consulting. His

16:01
clients are getting results. So that's a good

16:03
substitute for actually doing yourself as you've recommended it. It

16:06
ended up well and that's how you sell your consulting

16:08
gigs. But this is obviously the best proof you can

16:10
get. But at the same time, you could just start

16:12
off with a few courses, make a bit of content,

16:14
and sell that to a certain niche. And then you

16:17
start offering consulting as well. And again, you're just closely

16:19
monitoring all the results that you get out of the

16:21
education and consulting and using that as your proof in

16:23
order to get more customers. The key takeaways of this

16:26
section, understanding the barriers to AI adoption reveals why even

16:29
compelling technology faces resistance and how AI automation agencies can

16:33
create value by helping businesses overcome these fundamental challenges. First

16:36
thing, it ain't easy. Right? So successfully implementing AI systems

16:40
that provide a meaningful competitive edge without blowing up frequently

16:43
requires significant expertise. It is pretty tough. Production grade AI

16:47
applications are not not a walk in the park. The

16:50
current technology is not perfect and still requires a lot

16:52
of work to get right which makes it difficult for

16:54
businesses to dive in themselves.

16:56
So I mean it's even difficult for us as agencies

16:58
to do it. Can you imagine how difficult it would

17:00
be for businesses to do it themselves? That's why they

17:03
feel scared. That's why they feel completely out of their

17:05
depth and they want to pay you. The market reality

17:07
of this is that the AI adoption market breaks into

17:09
the distinct segments from completely unaware businesses to those ready

17:12
for implementation. And that's why you get a byproduct of

17:14
the technology adoption life cycle. That's these segments are the

17:17
sort of materialization of the the needs that come from

17:20
these different segments. Success means meeting businesses where they are

17:23
and guiding them forward with the right support at each

17:25
stage. Having the right products and services to be able

17:27
to accept businesses within your niche or within whatever area

17:31
that you're operating,

17:32
at various stages of the journey. Then Then we have

17:34
the 4 implementation barriers. Firstly, the awareness gap. Most remain

17:38
unaware of AI's true capabilities and practical business applications. They

17:41
still don't get why they need it or what it

17:44
even is. And many of them are quite happy living

17:46
in this little bubble. Then we have the strategy gap

17:48
where even interested businesses struggle to identify their best opportunities

17:51
and have confidence in executing it themselves. Then we have

17:53
the investment challenge where businesses then need to decide on,

17:57
okay, am I really willing to put this money up?

17:59
Is there a clear ROI for me here? And our

18:01
job as agencies is to communicate that clearly and give

18:03
them the confidence they need to make these big investments

18:06
that are gonna really change parts of the business from

18:07
the ground up. Then we have the management challenge. Sorry,

18:10
I forgot to add that 1 in. The ongoing management

18:12
and optimization of AI systems concerns businesses and this is

18:15
another opportunity for us to make money. Whether it's providing

18:17
ongoing sort of retainer services or if it's through saying,

18:20
hey, I will help you to build your own AI

18:22
department based off our experience. So even that, just that

18:25
alone could be your offer. We help businesses in the

18:29
x y z industry create their own internal AI expertise

18:32
and own AI division that's gonna be capable of managing

18:35
innovation. So you can plant people in there, you can

18:37
train their existing people up. There's so many different routes

18:39
you can take. But that alone would be a huge

18:41
business. Right? Being able to help them create their own

18:44
AI division that can do their own innovation and you

18:46
can sort of pass on your strategy on top of

18:48
that for them to execute. There's so much in here

18:51
for you guys to make money with. You just need

18:52
to pick where you wanna start. And finally, we have

18:54
human challenges around guiding both technical and human elements through

18:57
this transformation.

18:58
Dealing with difficult staff members, making sure the c suite

19:01
is fully educated and aligned.

19:03
There's a lot of human challenges that come with this

19:05
AI transformation within companies. Then we have the agency opportunity.

19:08
So each barrier is representing us a chance to create

19:10
value and make money from education and strategic guidance through

19:13
to implementation and optimization.

19:15
By understanding these challenges, agencies can structure these services to

19:18
help businesses successfully navigate the AI transformation journey. The path

19:22
forward from here is that success as an AI automation

19:24
agency means being able to identify where each business is

19:26
in their journey and provide exactly what support they need

19:29
to move forward 1 step at a time. Understanding these

19:31
implementation challenges is crucial for building an agency that can

19:33
effectively guide businesses through the AI transformation journey while creating

19:37
sustainable value at every step. Like I said, you don't

19:39
need to do all of them at once but just

19:41
be aware that these are the challenges that you'll need

19:43
to solve
