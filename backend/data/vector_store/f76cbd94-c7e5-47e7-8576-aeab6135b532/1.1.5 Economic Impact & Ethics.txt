Okay. So now looking at the economic impact and ethics.

00:03
So at a first glance, automating work would seem harmful.

00:06
After all, if a machine or AI system is gonna

00:08
do the job of several humans, wouldn't this create unemployment

00:10
and hardship? Now this concern, while understandable, misses the deeper

00:14
economic

00:15
realities that emerge when we follow the full chain of

00:17
effects through an economy. So let's start with the weaver's

00:19
tale which is a a good example,

00:21
sorry, of what happens when a new technology automates human

00:23
labor. Using 1 of history's clearest examples which is the

00:26
automation of weaving in the 18 hundreds in Britain. So

00:29
when the first mechanical looms appeared to create cloth,

00:32
they could produce cloth at a fraction of the time

00:34
and cost of the skilled hand weavers that made up

00:37
the weaving industry within Britain. The immediate effect seemed pretty

00:40
catastrophic. Right? You had thousands and thousands of weavers who

00:42
lost their livelihoods. These were skilled skilled workers who made

00:45
decent money. Their wages dropped massively and their family struggled.

00:49
And, this is where you had the Luddites, a group

00:51
of displaced workers from this technological revolution. They even began

00:55
destroying these machines in in protest. But this was only

00:58
the first effect as in the loss of the livelihoods,

01:00
families struggling. That was just the first effect in this

01:03
chain of of events. Right? What happened next reveals the

01:05
true economic story. So I'll circle back up to this

01:08
in a second. But, the dramatic drop in production costs

01:10
meant that the cloth became significantly cheaper and suddenly ordinary

01:14
families could afford multiple sets of clothes instead of just

01:16
1 or 2. This created explosive demand. More people wanted

01:19
more clothes and more styles and change more frequently. And

01:22
in order to meet the surging demand, factory owners invested

01:25
their profits into building more mills and buying more machines.

01:28
Each new factory needed workers, not just machine operators, but

01:31
managers, machines,

01:32
mechanics, clerks, salespeople, and transporters. Many children of displaced weavers

01:36
ended up earning more operating machines than their parents ever

01:39
made hand weaving. So if you look at this, reduction

01:41
in production cost of a given service or product, in

01:44
this case being cloth, that's just the first effect. Right?

01:47
1 step beyond that is the lower prices that's passed

01:50
on to the consumers. So instead of, cloth being a

01:53
hundred

01:54
dollars per

01:55
or 10 pounds or a pound back then or even

01:57
less, back then, per square meter, it halved or even

02:01
went down to maybe 20 percent or 10 percent of

02:03
what it was before because the machine is is providing

02:05
that much of a productivity boost. And so those get

02:07
passed on to the consumers who now naturally kind of

02:10
demand more and are interested in buying more of those

02:12
goods directly or of the related goods which we'll get

02:16
to in a second that come downstream of that. Basically,

02:19
lower prices of these increased demand and therefore, increased revenues

02:22
for these businesses as well. So with that increase in

02:25
revenues for the businesses and like massive increases in profits

02:28
because they can greatly reduce the cost of their goods

02:31
while still maintaining their profit margin and when demand goes

02:33
up, they're able to service that demand. And so with

02:35
those extra profits,

02:37
the capitalist or the industrialist,

02:39
the entrepreneur, in order for this whole system to work

02:41
is expected to reinvest at least a significant portion of

02:45
those profits. Those increased profits come from the the cutting

02:48
of people and the technological

02:49
advancement into expanding the business itself and using those profits

02:53
to deploy that capital, not just keep it tied up

02:55
in in money and in sort of liquid capital but

02:58
putting it into and deploying it into real capital, a

03:01
real wealth in in terms of machines,

03:03
in factories and that's ultimately going to hire a lot

03:06
more people and help to start alleviate the issues that

03:09
will cause at this first level. So that's part of

03:11
the kind of capitalist

03:12
deal that we're gonna sign up for here. And what

03:14
comes from that and the greatly increased production of this

03:17
much lower cost goods. We now have like dozens and

03:19
dozens more factories churning out so much more cloth at

03:22
much lower prices that you get entirely new industries that

03:24
emerge. You've got fashion. Now, when the the price of

03:26
cloth drops massively, people can afford instead of just 1

03:29
set of clothing like many people did in in Britain

03:31
and all around the world really for hundreds of years.

03:33
People could now afford to have multiple or have like

03:36
a nice Sunday outfit to go to church in. And

03:38
that just continue to increase increase increase and there was

03:40
this new demand for clothing and for an entire fashion

03:43
fashion industry to emerge. And so that created a a

03:46
huge business in itself or industry in itself. Then you

03:49
have the retail aspect of it where there's all these

03:51
stores that pop up to sell all these different items

03:53
from different brands. And then you have maintenance of the

03:56
of the machines themselves, and you have maintenance of clothes

03:58
and and you have like laundries and you have alterations

04:02
places. All of these new industries emerge from that reduction

04:04
in production cost. So while it isn't immediate, if the

04:07
capitalists hold up their end of the bargain and they

04:08
don't just pocket all of the money that they make

04:10
and they actually expand the productive base with the increased

04:14
profits, then the flooding of the market of a certain

04:16
certain good or service can help to create new industries

04:19
on top of it. So that's kind of the chain

04:21
of prosperity. That's how it's supposed to work in like,

04:23
some people would say that this is not how it

04:25
works at all. But from a from a like theoretical

04:27
economics, macroeconomic view. This is how this chain of prosperity

04:31
has taken us from whether you believe it or not,

04:33
a bunch of monkeys running around the jungle or at

04:35
least from people running around in the desert with not

04:39
much many clothes and not much money and milking goats

04:42
and stuff. Right? Whatever you believe in in the background

04:44
of our species. We came from somewhere a lot. Well,

04:46
basically, where we are these days and it's from this

04:48
cycle and the reason many of us live so long

04:50
now and have food that we we biggest issue we

04:53
have is obesity rather than starvation. All of these comes

04:55
from cycles like these where technology,

04:57
is sort of making ripple effects throughout the economy and

05:00
the capitalist make the most of it and creating new

05:02
industries and stuff like that. But there is the first

05:04
step which is is not very nice.

05:07
So the the the fix spread even further. Like I

05:08
said, the newly affordable cloth sparked the rise of the

05:11
fashion industry. We had department stores that emerged to sell

05:13
these abundant textiles. New businesses appeared around cleaning and maintaining

05:17
clothes. Each of these created entirely new types of jobs

05:19
that hadn't existed before. And meanwhile, all these newly employed

05:22
workers had more money to spend themselves. And they bought

05:25
not just clothes, but furnitures and books, better food and

05:27
entertainment. This increased spending in other industries, spurring them to

05:30
adopt their own productivity enhancing technologies as well, creating yet

05:33
more opportunities. So this is a repeating

05:36
pattern and the engine of prosperity for our civilization. It

05:38
has repeated over and over pretty much every major technological

05:42
advance. You have automobiles and cars which displaced horse shoes

05:45
and carriage makers and people who breed horses, but created

05:48
mechanics, car salesman, I mean, people running the the car

05:51
factories of course, which is a huge boom in the

05:53
United States and Japan and and even in Europe as

05:56
well. You have gas station operators, you've got road builders

05:58
and entire industries that are based around tourism and and

06:01
suburban development from the ability that for people to get

06:03
in their own personal automobile and drive around. Right? You

06:06
couldn't live that far out of the city until we

06:08
had cars. I said, there's all sorts of stuff that

06:09
came downstream of this. While in the short term, it

06:12
was like, man, this is awful for our our society

06:14
when what happens to the horse breeders and the horse

06:16
shoes and the people who scrape up the horse shit

06:18
from the streets, but I think, we'd all agree that

06:19
we're in a much better position now. Thanks to that,

06:22
invention. Personal computers, they eliminated many clerical jobs, admin and

06:26
sort of manual data entry, but they created programmers, of

06:29
course. You've got system administrators, data analysts, and countless new

06:32
categories of knowledge work that employ people at far higher

06:34
wages. So that was a massive step forward for us

06:37
as a species as well. And of course, the Internet

06:38
which disrupted traditional retail which would have been over but

06:41
created millions of jobs in e commerce, digital marketing, logistics

06:44
and the platform economy like YouTube and things like this.

06:46
So, we have the cycle where you've got new technology,

06:49
leads to lower production cost which leads to lower prices

06:51
which leads to increased demand. Therefore, business expansion after that

06:55
with the the increased profits and more jobs being created

06:58
and high consumer spending. And that ultimately can help to

07:00
spur onto other technologies being created as well.

07:03
Right now, AI stands poised to automate many cognitive tasks.

07:06
Those are the first ones in the chopping block. And

07:08
like the Luddites, many view this transition with fear. But

07:11
history shows that trying to prevent automation ultimately harms everyone

07:14
and it traps us in the less productive economy with

07:16
higher prices, lower wages, and fewer opportunities. This doesn't mean

07:19
the transition is painless. There's gonna be real people who

07:21
face real hardships when their jobs are automated and that's

07:24
we can't sort of get away from that. The solution

07:26
isn't to prevent the progress, but to support those affected

07:29
through the transition and helping them to retain or retrain,

07:31
sorry, for the new opportunities that inevitably emerge as this

07:35
technological advancement gets to play out. Alright? The ultimate truth

07:37
is that technological progress despite short term disruption for some

07:40
drives lasting prosperity for all through a virtual cycle of

07:43
lower costs, increased demand, business expansion, and more job creation.

07:46
Our task is to help manage this transition thoughtfully while

07:49
ensuring its benefits are broadly shared. The key takeaways here

07:51
is that understanding the economic impact of technology, technological progress

07:55
helps us implement AI automation responsibly while addressing common concerns

07:58
about job displacement. So we have the prosperity pattern, which

08:01
is history shows that automation, while initially disruptive, creates a

08:04
virtuous cycle of lower cost, increased demand, business expansion, and

08:07
ultimately, more employment opportunities than it eliminates. Long term for

08:10
short term. While technological change can cause painful for some

08:13
workers, attempting to prevent progress ultimately harm society by maintaining

08:16
higher cost and fewer opportunities. Basically, when you're doing this

08:19
and when you're out there working with businesses, don't feel

08:21
bad. Right? This this is how progress happens. And our

08:24
world is in real really a massive need for a

08:26
productivity boost right now. Like productivity increase rates are at

08:29
an all time low until AI showed up, and we've

08:31
got stagnating economies, we've got economies on the brink of

08:33
collapse. Uh-huh. We've got debt in the US that they

08:36
can't seem to get under control and I mean, like,

08:38
we maybe the only ones who can really save them.

08:40
Like, these small businesses, medium sized businesses who may just

08:43
get crushed here. Like, if we can actually bring meaningful

08:45
productivity gains to them, and help them to adapt to

08:48
this new technology and use in a way that allows

08:49
them to let go some of some of the people

08:51
who shouldn't be working for them or they don't need

08:53
to be working for them anymore and invest in systems

08:55
that allow them to scale their business even more and

08:57
grow the business and and reduce the costs of their

08:59
services for their clients or their products for their clients.

09:01
You gotta see the the second and third and fourth

09:03
order consequences

09:04
as you play them out. It's not nice, but if

09:06
you really super duper feel sad about being involved in

09:09
this, letting letting go of people, then set aside a

09:11
portion of your profits to pay for retraining programs for

09:14
employees that are made redundant. This is something that even

09:16
us in morning side, we'd like to get set up

09:18
at some point when we have these really robust training

09:20
programs of people who wanna reskill an AI automation. So

09:23
maybe if you wanted to save your pennies for the

09:24
end, then you can make a donation to the sort

09:26
of charitable fund that we'll be setting up for, or

09:28
or non profit that's, gonna do this kind of retraining

09:31
as a feel good and, do good, venture from us.
