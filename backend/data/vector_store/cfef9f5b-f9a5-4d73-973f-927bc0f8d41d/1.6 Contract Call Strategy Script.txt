Perfect. Let's talk about proposal calls or contract calls as

00:03
we really should call them. So they are called proposal

00:06
calls, but you always wanna refer to it as a

00:08
contract call once you've actually hit that stage. Obviously, you

00:12
can call it proposal call before you get onto the

00:14
proposal call, because it makes it, I guess,

00:18
it's less impact. Right? It's, it's lower commitment to hop

00:21
on. I can hop on a proposal call, like I

00:23
can always say no. But when you get on the

00:25
call, you want to say call. Why? Because a proposal

00:28
call implies that it's this kind of big thing. You're

00:31
moving into a big relationship type thing. Think of it

00:34
like a wedding.

00:35
You can't really you can say no, but you can't

00:37
really adjust things. Right? You can say yes or no

00:39
really. Whereas a contract call shows very black and white

00:42
what what you're getting. Again, I think it's a little

00:44
bit lower, a little bit

00:46
less commitment when you're actually on it to sign a

00:49
proposal or sign a contract. I'd rather sign a contract.

00:52
And of course, you can you can see it all

00:54
black and white. You can adjust it. You can negotiate.

00:57
I prefer a contract call. You can call it a

00:59
proposal call if you want. I like to call it

01:01
a contract call. Anyways, let's just jump into it. So,

01:03
what are we gonna do? We're gonna start reintroducing ourselves.

01:06
Further rapport building can never do too much. We're gonna

01:09
take control. We're gonna set intention.

01:11
We're gonna reiterate our problems and pain points and dig

01:13
even deeper guys. Then we're gonna reiterate hell which is

01:16
their current situation and reiterate heaven which is their desired

01:19
situation. Obviously, in discovery call, we pulled it back. We're

01:22
gonna rip that thing open and see everything.

01:26
So you might notice steps 1 to 5 are the

01:28
exact same. I know. Surprise, surprise. Then we move into

01:32
6 to 11, which is the big stuff. Right? So

01:34
then we're going to build really strong commitment, which is

01:36
important. Get your building permit, which is vital.

01:40
Redirect our expertise,

01:41
present our proposition or solution,

01:44
and then we're going to temp check, and then we're

01:45
going to price and close.

01:48
So once again, the start off instruction building report. Hey,

01:51
how are you going today, Liam?

01:53
Hey, I'm great too, thanks. You know, gosh, it's been

01:55
a hectic day for me. The clients are going to

01:57
be up left, right, and center, but, hey, I mean,

02:00
busy means business. Right? So I'm always up for it.

02:02
Hey. That's an amazing piece of artwork behind you. Where

02:05
did you get that from?

02:06
Hey, Liam. Looks like a pretty gloomy day over there.

02:09
Perfect day to get a lot of work done. Stuff

02:11
like this. Right?

02:13
Taking control, setting intention. Hey, Liam. So we're scheduled here

02:16
for 45 minutes and I do have a call right

02:18
after this. So I wouldn't give you as much of

02:19
my value in this short amount of time. With that

02:22
being said, Liam, do you mind if we get straight

02:24
underway?

02:24
Sure.

02:26
Okay. Great. So So obviously, we spoke the other day

02:28
and today I just want to confirm what we spoke

02:30
about first and of course, further clarify a few things

02:33
and understand a few things. Obviously, our last call, I

02:36
got a really good indication as to exactly how I

02:38
can help you and help you get to heaven and

02:41
get over hell. We define that.

02:45
So just so we are on the same page, if

02:46
I am not mistaken, the big overarching crutch that's holding

02:49
you back from heaven

02:51
would be

02:52
problem. Is that correct?

02:55
And this is something that's been holding you back from

02:58
that heaven for time period, right?

03:02
Etcetera, we're just reiterating here. Then we'll start asking questions

03:05
that dig a little deeper. You know, you guys can

03:07
go from there. We're gonna reiterate help which is going

03:10
to again do the same thing. Quickly reiterate exactly where

03:13
they are, things that they've been dealing with, how they've

03:16
tried to overcome certain things. So, so, you know, Liam,

03:18
if I'm not mistaken, obviously, you,

03:21
engaged a previous agency in the past and you didn't

03:24
see great results from them and the reason was because

03:26
of this and this. Am I correct?

03:28
Oh, and that too? Amazing. Great. And tell me, what

03:31
would,

03:32
what would they what could they do different specifically for

03:35
you guys that would make a massive impact on how

03:37
that relationship went? Obviously, assuming obviously,

03:40
now that it's it's now passed, they can't really make

03:43
up for that nor that nor should they have to,

03:45
but, you know, what would you have liked to have

03:47
seen? And so we're talking about them, not about us,

03:49
but, obviously, we take that

03:52
on for us. You know, further questions to dig deeper

03:54
and amplify at the same time.

03:56
So pulling that curtain right back. Same thing with the

03:58
heaven, we're going to quickly reiterate heaven and ask any

04:01
further questions to dig deeper and amplify.

04:03
And now we get on to building strong commitment. This

04:06
is where stuff gets quite important.

04:08
So this stuff, this step is all about making them

04:11
say out loud

04:12
why, when, and how they want to fix their problem

04:15
and achieve their desired situation.

04:18
Great, so with all that being said, why not stay

04:21
where you are, Liam? I mean you're currently doing x

04:23
y z dollars per month. Why not stay here? Why

04:26
strive for location freedom or heaven or whatever heaven is

04:30
if it's location freedom.

04:31
This will get them to really think about it and

04:34
go, yeah I guess why why do I want to

04:36
move forward and don't accept surface level answers here. Don't

04:39
go if they say, oh you know I'd I'd like

04:42
to make more money. Be like, yeah. Absolutely. You know,

04:44
you're looking for an increase in 10 k per month

04:47
which is no short amount, but

04:50
more so than just the money, what can that really

04:52
do for you guys? And something I like to say

04:54
is I like to say, yeah. So for for my

04:56
clients,

04:57
I I tend to see the clients that do really

04:59
well and the ones that I work really well with

05:01
are those who have a lot of skin in the

05:03
game and they have a real reason for doing something

05:05
and that they do it. So with that being said,

05:07
obviously you're looking to increase your your monthly rent your

05:10
monthly income by 10 k per month.

05:13
What does that mean for you obviously personally? Because I

05:16
understand how it can mean for you professionally, but what

05:18
does that mean for you personally? Now what's in it

05:20
for you? And you can dig deep and build strong

05:22
commitments. So they're going to go

05:24
this is why they're going to be like yes I

05:25
you know I really want to do this and these

05:27
are the reasons.

05:28
How soon would you like to get a safe and

05:30
care off is another great question to ask.

05:33
Great. So now

05:35
you know their current situation, a, which is the hell.

05:37
You know their desired situation, which is b, the heaven.

05:41
And you know how badly they wanna transform that and

05:43
go from here to here. All we need to do

05:45
now is get the building permit to build the bridge

05:47
which is your offer to go from here to here.

05:50
Simple as that. You need that bridge. You need that

05:52
vehicle essentially. You need the building permit.

05:54
You can't build a bridge from heaven hell without building

05:56
permission.

05:58
Alright, Liam. I can clearly see the reasons you aren't

06:00
where you want to be and I know how how

06:02
I can help you solve this. Do you mind if

06:04
I tell you a little bit more about what we

06:05
do and how I can help you?

06:08
Simple as that.

06:10
Next, we reiterate our expertise. Now you can share what

06:13
you do and how you can help them, but remember

06:15
this isn't your pitch. This is you chatting about expertise

06:18
and what you're all about.

06:19
Amazing. So, Liam, as I've said, I typically get invited

06:22
in by CEOs, managers, directors of successful and ambitious companies

06:26
in niche, which is their niche. And I can help

06:28
them with problem, which is their problem. And I do

06:30
this with solution, which is gonna be their solution.

06:33
And these results we've seen. You don't wanna talk too

06:36
much about this. You're not remember it's not a pitch,

06:39
but, you're reiterating your expertise. I'm just keeping this simple

06:41
for you guys to understand.

06:43
So focus on the outcome and not the features. This

06:45
just depends on your audience and niche and what you're

06:47
selling. Your prospect should really be thinking by the end

06:50
of this,

06:51
great. This is exactly what I'm looking for. And especially

06:54
when you say this is what I've done for my

06:55
previous clients like great this is what I want. I

06:57
want to be a part of this too.

06:59
When you finish with your sentence be quiet, let it

07:02
sink in. Awkward silence is good because it makes them

07:05
ask questions which is what we want and a really

07:07
great way of doing this is with 1 of

07:12
these.

07:14
Don't use a water bottle because you look like a

07:15
dork.

07:16
But you'll you'll notice there, I was sorry. My mic's

07:20
falling.

07:20
Oh, we're gonna kick on. I'm gonna hold it. You

07:23
would have noticed there that obviously I took a drink

07:25
from my water bottle. And

07:27
you guys

07:28
didn't feel uncomfortable. It's not like I was just staring

07:30
at you blankly and you go, shit, is this video

07:32
unpause? What's happening? No. I was taking a drink from

07:35
my water bottle, you saw me do it, You you

07:37
weren't put off by it. It's okay. And you can

07:39
do the same on your sales calls. This is a

07:41
great technique that I love to do.

07:43
If I want a breather, I'll have a drink. If

07:45
I want the other person to say something and I

07:48
don't want to say something, I want to let them

07:49
talk, I'll have a drink. It shows them that, hey,

07:53
it's your turn to talk because I can't. I'm drinking.

07:56
Again, don't use a water bottle, especially 1 that says

07:58
I heart fry. The fries are cool.

08:00
But you look like a bit of a dork, especially

08:02
if it's like a little sippy cup bottle, which is

08:04
what I got here. Use a glass of water. It

08:06
looks way better, but,

08:08
anyways.

09:56
So if they say, perfect. Let's let's move forward. Let's

09:58
do it. I'm happy. You know, Ollie, I I I

10:00
love what you're saying. Let's make it happen. I wish

10:02
you can close them. Right? Simple as that. But,

10:05
you know, they're going to usually throw an objection at

10:08
us, or usually they're just gonna say, you know, great.

10:11
Like, you know, can we talk about price? Or, you

10:13
know, can we how how can we move forward to

10:16
something like this again, which is fine. In which case,

10:18
we're gonna temp check them. Or we're gonna objection handle

10:20
and then temp check them, and then objection handle after

10:22
temp checking because that's all temp checking is. So Liam,

10:24
with all that being said, on a scale of 1

10:26
to 10, how confident are you that we can help

10:29
take you from heaven, define that, to hell. I need

10:32
to find that. Sorry. Hell to heaven.

10:34
Now we objection handle. This is where most sales are

10:37
lost. This is incredibly important and sets the good closes

10:40
apart from the great, and in all honesty, is a

10:43
massive part of sales.

10:45
It's not something we're gonna talk about so much within,

10:47
this this free course, because this isn't a mastermind, this

10:51
is an accelerated introduction for you guys. It is something

10:53
we talk about within the accelerator. For example, I have

10:56
a mini course if you're already in accelerator about, objection

10:59
handling. But usually, it's something that

11:01
we really should be talking about on our live sessions

11:04
or on our coaching calls, in which case, you know,

11:06
obviously, I can break down a lot of detail, answer

11:08
the objections you're getting directly, so you know what to

11:11
say when you do get those objections on those calls,

11:13
and you know how to sign those clients. Right. So

11:15
it is really important. Sets the good apart from the

11:18
great,

11:19
but something we're not gonna talk about so much. Usually,

11:21
on a scale of 1 to 10, they're gonna give

11:23
us a 7 or an 8.

11:25
Sweet. If it's a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, we're

11:27
usually in strife, which is bad.

11:29
But, you know, we're gonna say, okay. Great. So, Liam,

11:32
why are you at 7 or why are you at

11:34
8 as opposed to a 10? You know, what what

11:36
are you still figuring out? What are you not so

11:38
clear about? What can I do to to help clarify

11:40
that? You don't wanna seem like, oh, what can I

11:43
do to convince you? Or say, what can I do

11:45
to, you know, inform you to to really see where

11:47
we are? Is there something that we're missing? Because you

11:49
wanna assume that if they're not a 10 out of

11:51
10, they don't understand it properly. You don't wanna assume

11:54
they're not a 10 out of 10, so I need

11:55
to convince them. So Leah might say,

11:59
how do I know this work for me? I gotta

12:00
talk to my spouse. Any of those great objections that

12:02
we just have to smash through.

12:04
And then usually, you'll get to the price point. Right?

12:06
And that's where we deliver

12:08
the price and the close.

12:11
So objection handling sets the great so it sets the

12:13
good from the great apart. The pricing close sets the

12:16
great and the godly apart. Genuinely.

12:20
Liam, assuming the investment was right today, is this something

12:22
you would wanna move forward with? Simple as that.

12:26
I usually say something like, yes, yes, assuming the investment

12:28
is right, this is something I would like to move

12:30
forward. Or or no, it's not.

12:33
This is why. And again, you objection handle.

12:35
So you get to this point and you say, great.

12:37
We're gonna love this part then, Liam. I want this

12:40
to be a start of a strong business relationship, and

12:42
we can help get you to heaven as best we

12:44
can. For what we're doing for you, it's just price.

12:48
And that's for me and my team at literally all

12:50
times, here for you in every way we can add

12:52
value. I've just shot you the payment link in chat.

12:54
However, we can split it up as well. Are you

12:56
able to pay upfront, or do we need to split

12:58
things up here? So this is,

13:01
I forget what it's called. I think it's called the

13:02
wave the wave technique, the wave close.

13:04
That's something I'm not gonna talk about here because we're

13:06
getting a little bit a little bit high level now.

13:10
But this is a very basic and very presentable way

13:13
for a beginner to present their price and close. Right.

13:16
It's nothing crazy. We're not gonna talk too much about

13:18
that. Again, this isn't a mastermind or or master class

13:20
on this. This is, a more introductory type thing. Something

13:23
we can talk or we do talk about within the

13:25
accelerator, and something we can talk about on our coaching

13:28
calls as well if you are within the program. If

13:30
not, then, obviously, you're going to have to figure it

13:33
out.

13:34
But

13:35
if you're gonna do a free, which I assume a

13:36
lot of you will, you want to put the price

13:39
at the end because it brings more gravitas. It, just

13:42
brings a bit more impact to the idea that it

13:44
is free. Remember, just because it's free doesn't mean it

13:46
doesn't cost the prospect anything. It still costs them their

13:48
time, still is a is a hard thing for them

13:50
to commit to. So putting the the monetary price at

13:53
the end is great. So you go, great. We're gonna

13:55
love this part then. I want this to be a

13:57
start up for a strong business relationship and help you

13:59
get to heaven as best we can.

14:01
And that's for me and my team at literally all

14:04
times, here for you in every way we can add

14:06
value. For what we're gonna do for you, it's just

14:09
price, if it's a low price or it's completely free.

14:12
All I ask is a great testimonial, or, you know,

14:14
whatever you are asking. Right? And that's it. That's a

14:17
price and a close. And in all honesty, they should

14:20
say yes, you should collect payment, yada yada yada, and

14:22
go from there, however, you know, you wish to do

14:23
that, usually Stripe and stuff. Right? And that's it. This

14:26
is you now. An absolute client closing chat. Huge congrats,

14:30
guys. So I hope you've enjoyed the sales section of

14:33
this course.

14:34
Obviously, this is a a quick run through, and I've

14:37
I've really just distilled everything best I can. And in

14:39
a beginner way for anyone to pick this up,

14:43
I do assume that some maybe some guys coming from

14:46
agency,

14:47
or SMA, whatever it may be, or coming from different

14:49
facets of entrepreneurship and business will probably get a lot

14:52
out of this as well, even though it is a

14:53
beginner level. But, please feel free to ask any questions

14:56
if you are in the Discord family, Zoom myself. If

14:59
you're on the Discord, whether it be the free side

15:01
or the accelerated,

15:03
you you are accelerated member, feel free to add me

15:05
on Instagram. Please don't ask me any questions on Instagram.

15:08
Please save that for the Discord. That's why it's there,

15:11
guys, and I checked the Discord heaps anyways. So it's

15:13
fine.

15:14
But, yeah. I really hope you guys got a lot

15:16
of value, and you do get a lot of success

15:18
out of what we just taught, what we just talked

15:20
about, and I look forward to seeing

15:23
you guys grow your triple a's. Thanks very much, and

15:26
enjoy the rest of your day, your week, or or

15:28
your night, or wherever you are. Cheers, guys.
