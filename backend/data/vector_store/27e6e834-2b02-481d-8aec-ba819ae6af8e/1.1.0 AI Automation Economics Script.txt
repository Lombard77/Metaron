Hello, everyone, and welcome to AI Automation Economics.

00:03
This is a personal favorite of mine, and I'm excited

00:05
to share this with you all, and giving you a

00:07
bit more context on how and why businesses adopt AI,

00:11
the driving forces behind it, where AI really drives the

00:14
most value for businesses, and some key concepts for you

00:16
to understand moving forward. Firstly, we're gonna be covering the

00:19
business value proposition of AI. We're going to be getting

00:21
into the implementation challenge surrounding it. What is stopping businesses

00:25
from doing it? And the things that they are going

00:27
to run into that you essentially have to guide them

00:29
through. Then we'll be covering the evolution of work through

00:31
the various types of systems that we've had and will

00:34
have in the near future. Then we'll cover the strategic

00:36
implications of AI adoption for businesses. Then we'll get into

00:39
the future of AI services and how us as AI

00:41
agencies are going to survive as AI begins to creep

00:44
and encroach on the very things that we are trying

00:46
to sell and automate. And finally, we'll be looking at

00:49
the macroeconomic impact and the ethical side of AI automation

00:53
within businesses and how us as AI agency owners can

00:56
tread the seemingly thin line between ethical and unethical business

00:59
practices when selling AI automation services. So to succeed as

01:03
an AI automation agency owner, you need to understand more

01:05
than just technical features. You need to grasp why businesses

01:08
are economically compelled to adopt AI. This knowledge will transform

01:12
you from a service provider into a strategic advisor who

01:15
can identify valuable opportunities and guide businesses through their digital

01:19
transformation. When you understand the economics driving AI adoption, you'll

01:22
know exactly why businesses need to to act now and

01:24
be able to articulate the true cost of waiting to

01:27
them. So this isn't just theory, it's the foundation for

01:29
everything we'll build in the solution source recourse. And in

01:32
this video, we're gonna be covering those sections that I

01:34
just covered on the slideshow before. Just for a bit

01:37
of context, this image here is of a, entrepreneur or

01:40
business owner, and he's looking at a loom, a mechanical

01:43
loom that is going to revolutionize his factory and potentially

01:46
put all of these people out of work who were

01:48
doing weaving and were making textiles for them. This is

01:51
exactly what happened in historically. The mechanization of the textile

01:54
industry would have put thousands and thousands and thousands out

01:57
of jobs within England, but ultimately paved the way for

01:59
England to become the leader in global textiles. Where in

02:01
India, it became cheaper to purchase British made textiles because

02:04
they were just so cheap and then import them into

02:06
India than just to make them in locally within India

02:09
themselves. And the mechanization of various industries within Britain during

02:12
the industrial revolution is a great example in case that

02:15
we will look at later. To give us a reference

02:17
point on how AI is really going to be affecting

02:19
businesses and the trade offs that we have to make

02:21
between people or machines and efficiency and the wider effects

02:24
that it can have on the economy.

02:28
So getting into the business value proposition, understanding AI's economic

02:31
impact. At its core, business operates as a continuous competition

02:34
for profits in the world of scarce resources. And everyday

02:36
companies are battling to capture customer spending by delivering superior

02:40
value while managing costs. So this competitive pressure creates a

02:43
fascinating chain reaction in the economy that drives innovation forward.

02:46
When 1 business finds a way to operate more efficiently,

02:48
say by automating a key process, they gain an advantage.

02:52
Their cost of creating that same product or service will

02:54
likely go down. Therefore, they can lower the prices while

02:57
maintaining profits and reinvest those savings into improvement

03:00
or into a combination of both. At the same time,

03:03
their competitors will face a choice to either adapt and

03:06
match this efficiency or gradually lose customers to the more

03:09
efficient competitor.

03:10
So here we have a company that is applying AI

03:12
in this case. Back in the day, it may have

03:14
just been a mechanization of some of the automated key

03:17
parts of the production process.

03:19
But because the cost are dropping for these companies that

03:22
are automating parts of their process and decreasing the cost

03:25
of producing the goods or services, their profits can go

03:27
up while even just remaining at the same price. So

03:30
if they can sell their hamburger for 5 dollars while

03:33
the rest of them are still selling it for 5

03:34
dollars but they can be making an extra dollar in

03:37
profit compared to everyone else. Reinvest those profits into other

03:40
things like marketing etcetera. Or what is more likely to

03:43
happen or depending on the industry of course, they will

03:45
decrease the cost of their burger to say 4 dollars

03:49
and still keep 1 dollar in profit and the increase

03:51
in demand of everyone else, all the other customers being

03:55
drawn away from these laggard,

03:56
slower companies to buy the the dollar cheaper burger from

04:00
the company who's leaning into automation will allow them to

04:02
increase their revenues while still remaining profitability. And so this

04:05
chain reaction that we're talking about is that when it's

04:07
realized that this company is doing it, it becomes okay

04:09
well now in order to compete, we have to do

04:12
the same. And as we'll see much later in this

04:14
document, this creates a very powerful cycle for innovation and

04:17
for decreasing costs, increasing the amount of goods that consumers

04:20
can buy with a limited amount of resources and limited

04:22
amount of money, and that ends up being hugely beneficial

04:25
for society and is responsible for all of the growth

04:27
that we've we've seen over the past few hundred years.

04:32
That takes us into the core benefits of AI systems.

04:34
So we need to really get a good grip on

04:36
the fundamental advantages that make AI such a transformative force

04:40
in business operations Because I think in a lot of

04:42
times people go, oh yeah, AI this, AI that. And

04:44
if you ask them what are the core benefits of

04:46
AI systems, they couldn't actually outline what I'm about to

04:49
tell you right now. So

04:51
this is from

04:52
being in the trenches, seeing in production how these things

04:55
actually help businesses.

04:57
And a lot of them are sort of hidden invisible

04:59
ones that people wouldn't necessarily see. Oh, yeah. I mean,

05:01
it's it's scalable. Oh, it's cheaper. Oh, but there's actually

05:04
a lot more to it. So that's what we're gonna

05:06
be covering here. So the first core benefit of AI

05:08
systems is their unlimited scalability or unlimited of course as

05:12
caveats, but, generally, it can scale as much as you

05:15
need within the laws of physics. Right? And so consider

05:17
a basic customer service operation. In a traditional model, handling

05:20
more customers means hiring more agents,

05:23
each requiring salary, benefits, training, and management overhead.

05:27
So your costs, as you expand this customer service team

05:30
and then scale the rest of the business, your costs

05:32
are going to rise in direct proportion to your growth.

05:34
Because if you need a 1 sales rep at a

05:36
hundred thousand, then you might need 2 at 200000 a

05:38
month. Right? But an AI system can handle 10 or

05:42
10000

05:43
customer queries with nearly identical performance and only marginal cost

05:46
increases. So this fundamental shift creates a several powerful advantages

05:50
for businesses. Firstly, you have 0 coordination overhead. Each new

05:53
human that you hire and the big your team gets,

05:56
it creates exponential communication complexity.

05:58
As Brian Chesky, the founder of Airbnb in, this

06:02
interview

06:03
notes, that every person brings with them a communication tax.

06:06
AI eliminates this entirely. No meetings, no management layers, no

06:10
communication bottlenecks. Smaller organizations are better in almost every way.

06:14
So while there is a big flex about, oh, I've

06:16
got like hundreds of people working for me. In reality,

06:18
maybe a 50 to a hundred person team that has

06:22
AI systems to support them would be much better and

06:24
much more efficient because there isn't this communication tax happening.

06:27
So having a gigantic customer support team makes it very

06:30
difficult to distribute information to them, to manage them more

06:32
effectively, to pay all these benefits and training, and having

06:35
managers upon managers. The smaller the organization can be, the

06:38
better it is generally. Then we have the benefit of

06:40
instant deployment, where if you improve an AI system, every

06:43
single interaction immediately after you deploy that receives those changes

06:46
and gets those benefits. Right? So you're not having to

06:49
have massive training sessions for staff. You don't have these

06:52
adoption curves for bringing people up to speed. You've got

06:54
no stragglers where there's a few members on your team

06:56
who need to be brought up and checked and and

06:57
are lagging behind the training. So when you make changes

07:00
and you deploy it to production,

07:02
immediately those changes are gonna be effective working within the

07:05
system as it's live, and interacting with users. Then we

07:07
have predictable quality. So whether you're handling a hundred or

07:09
10000 interactions, the AI system is gonna be delivering nearly

07:13
identical performance and there's gonna be minimal variation in quality

07:16
as you scale. Now this is relative to performance of

07:19
human based teams. So this one's a minimal variation because

07:23
this really comes down to the the ability of you

07:25
as a development team to engineer a system in a

07:28
way that it doesn't have much variation. That's tricky when

07:30
we're dealing with non deterministic technology and generative AI models

07:34
to get it to have minimal variation.

07:36
But the point is that if you have engineered it

07:38
correctly, if it works for a hundred with a very

07:40
low erroring rate, then you can scale it up to

07:43
10000 with that same error rate. So, unlike human teams,

07:46
you get much more predictable quality as you scale them

07:49
as there's not differences between each new rep you'd bring

07:52
on. And we have a more linear cost structure. So

07:54
growth costs are going to stay nearly flat primarily consisting

07:57
of the computational resources rather than increased human overhead. So

08:01
here you can see that human teams while they start

08:03
off as being,

08:04
very cheap and very low complexity, you might just hire

08:07
1 customer support rep and say, hey, can you just

08:09
hop into this inbox and answer things? But as you

08:11
begin to scale, the and and the volume of tickets

08:13
and the size of your business increases, the cost is

08:16
going to increase in a linear fashion,

08:18
in lockstep basically in proportion to the increase in growth.

08:21
So okay, now we're doing 10 times the number of

08:23
orders. We're going to need 10 times as many customer

08:25
support reps unless you build better systems, of course. And

08:28
therefore, the costs are gonna scale in proportion to the

08:30
scale of the business. And also, you're gonna deal with

08:32
increasing complexity where you're having to deal with multiple layers

08:34
of management potentially. Or you've now having to put a

08:36
customer support, a head of customer support and you've got

08:39
multiple different people under them. And the complexity of communication

08:42
like Brian Chesky notes here, which I highly recommend you

08:44
watch this video. Very, very good on management. The complexity

08:47
of the system is gonna increase as you have more

08:49
people moving around. You've got extra things to manage like

08:51
people needing time off, compensation and bonuses and things like

08:54
this. And with AI systems, you have a much more

08:57
straightforward set of problems to deal with really. As you

08:59
can see, it's a lot more complex and costly to

09:01
set up initially, but the benefits are going to scale

09:04
much better as you increase volume. You're only gonna get

09:06
slight increases in cost and complexity. That's because you've done

09:09
all of the hard work upfront to get it working

09:11
at this 100. And as they scale up, all that's

09:14
gonna increase is the amount of compute you're using and

09:16
like the API costs you're gonna pay for the generative

09:18
AI models, that you're using. So it's gonna be much

09:21
better as you scale and the complexity of the system

09:23
is going to remain relatively stable throughout that whole period.

09:26
The next core benefits of AI systems is enhanced customer

09:29
experience. So imagine a global business serving customers across different

09:32
countries and time zones. A traditional approach requires multiple office

09:35
locations, complex scheduling, and limited language coverage. An AI system

09:39
transforms this completely. So AI systems can always be available

09:42
where customers get instant responses at 3 AM on Christmas

09:45
day just as they would at 3 PM on Tuesday.

09:47
No more, our office is currently closed. AI systems are

09:49
often multilingual by default as well. The same AI system

09:52
can fluently communicate in dozens of languages eliminating the need

09:55
for specialized language teams or translation services. You also get

09:59
a much more consistent service with every customer getting the

10:01
same high quality experience

10:03
regardless of when or how they reach out. No more

10:05
variation between the good and bad support agents. The impact

10:08
on business operations is transformative.

10:10
You've got higher customer satisfaction from instant consistent service. You've

10:13
got expanded global reach without increased operational complexity as in

10:17
having multiple different languages,

10:19
support teams that have different languages. And I am still

10:21
going on this customer support example we talked about before.

10:23
You're gonna see reduced customer churn from service issues and

10:26
you're gonna have an increased customer lifetime value if all

10:28
of these things are in place. This combination of unlimited

10:31
scalability and enhanced customer experience creates a powerful competitive advantage

10:34
that's difficult for traditional operations to match. It's not just

10:37
about doing things cheaper, it's about doing them in a

10:39
fundamentally better way.

10:41
Another benefit is the consistency and systematic improvement of AI

10:44
systems. So while humans have good and bad days, AI

10:47
systems deliver the same consistent performance around the clock, again,

10:51
if you've engineered them correctly. More importantly, they enable systematic

10:54
improvement through data driven optimization. Every interaction becomes a learning

10:58
opportunity. When an AI handles a customer conversation or processes

11:01
a sales lead, it generates valuable data about what works

11:04
and what doesn't. AKA, I said these things and this

11:07
person ended up being a qualified lead or I spoke

11:10
to this person and resolved the ticket successfully. You are

11:12
collecting all of this data in real time. I mean,

11:14
you technically are still if you're in front of a

11:16
human on the phone, but the big difference in this

11:17
comes with this next point. So, give me a second.

11:20
This constant stream of information enables continuous refinement of the

11:23
system's performance, which brings us to rapid testing. So, when

11:25
you have all of this data, you're saying, okay. Well,

11:27
this kind of conversation script worked for this in these

11:30
examples, and these ones didn't seem to, then you can

11:32
use this data to inform rapid testing of the system

11:35
to improve it, say, for your customer support or say,

11:37
for your AI cold calling system or for your AI

11:40
sales rep, if you wanna take it that far as

11:42
well. But traditional AB testing requires coordinating multiple teams and

11:45
members over weeks or months. With AI systems, you can

11:47
test different approaches simultaneously across thousands of interactions, gathering statistically

11:51
significant data in days rather than months. So if you

11:54
wanna run a split test on a sales team, say,

11:56
let's change the script from this to this. That's gonna

11:58
take, a bunch of training, a bunch of documentation,

12:01
a bunch of monitoring to make sure that they're actually

12:02
sticking to the script. Whereas if you just update and

12:05
and redeploy the AI sales group that you've built, it's

12:07
going to immediately put that into action across thousands of

12:10
interactions over the coming days where you can get data

12:12
back and make a decision. You also have centralized updates

12:15
like I talked about before where if you would improve

12:16
an AI system, every single future interaction benefits immediately. So

12:20
you don't have to train human teams for updates take

12:22
weeks to roll out. AI improvements deploy instantly across all

12:25
operations. Then we have resource optimization as another core benefit

12:28
of AI systems. So AI can fundamentally change how businesses

12:32
allocate the resources. Firstly, by focusing on high value work

12:35
as by handling the routine tasks automatically, AI is able

12:38
to free human team members to focus on work that

12:39
truly requires creativity and judgment, AKA our human skills or

12:39
the areas that

12:41
creativity and judgment, AKA our human skills or the areas

12:45
that humans are really the best at. So instead of

12:47
spending hours in repetitive tasks, teams of your clients can

12:49
concentrate on strategy, complex problem solving, and building relationships. Secondly,

12:53
they eliminate operational waste. Traditional operations often require paying for

12:57
capacity you don't need. You've got quiet periods in customer

13:00
service, you've got downtime in sales, or excess staffing for

13:03
occasional peaks. AI systems can help you eliminate this waste

13:06
by operating exactly when needed and only consuming resources during

13:10
actual use. So this is an interesting 1 to keep

13:11
in mind if you're working with a certain type of

13:13
business that has these big surges and and peaks. AI

13:16
systems can be particularly helpful for them as they rapidly

13:18
need to scale up and then scale down without overextending

13:20
and and

13:21
hiring too many people and having to wind down and

13:23
going through a much longer process than necessary. Thirdly, we

13:26
have predictable costs. With human teams, you get cost fluctuating

13:29
a lot based on overtime, additional training needs, and variable

13:32
performance if they're just not doing the work that you

13:34
need them to do in the time that they typically

13:36
do it. They're having a bad day or a bad

13:38
week and they start underperforming. And it might be to

13:40
do with something that's outside of work entirely. It might

13:43
be a personal thing. But with AI systems, they can

13:45
provide clear and predictable operational expenses based on actual usage,

13:49
making it easier to budget and plan effectively. And finally,

13:51
we have flexible scaling. Need to handle twice as many

13:53
customer inquiries this week? AI systems scale instantly to meet

13:56
demand and scale back down when volume decreases. This flexibility

14:00
eliminates the traditional challenges of hiring, training, and managing variable

14:03
capacity. So very similar to what I said here. Right?

14:05
So now we've covered the core benefits of AI systems,

14:07
we can get into what I call the AI paradox.

14:10
And it's a really powerful concept to understand how these

14:13
benefits can really fit into a business and provide additional

14:16
second order consequences for businesses. Sure you get the upfront

14:18
benefits of AI like we've just been over. But some

14:21
of the things that I've just gone through there with

14:22
you materialize in different ways that add up to this

14:25
sort of less tangible but still incredibly valuable difference for

14:28
a business. The AI paradox is when AI systems create

14:31
more business value than their human based equivalent despite being

14:34
worse at individual tasks due to factors like ease of

14:37
scaling, cost reductions, increased availability, etcetera. So basically, even if

14:42
the AI system is much worse at doing something, the

14:44
other benefits discussed above can mean the company makes profit

14:47
or is even better overall in the eyes of the

14:49
business owner. So let's break this down with a real

14:51
example of an AI versus human sales rep. So the

14:54
human sales rep, you might be likely to get a

14:55
25 percent close rate. They're available for 8 hours a

14:58
day and they can do 8 to 10 calls daily.

15:00
They of course require management and training. Then you have

15:02
the AI sales system that you as an agency may

15:05
offer to your clients. You engineer it, you build it,

15:07
you use in voice agents and you have it on

15:09
triggers and they can sort of book immediately. That might

15:11
have a 5 percent close rate. Right? Let's be honest,

15:13
if you hop on a phone and you had an

15:15
AI agent that was trying to close you over the

15:17
phone, a bunch of people would detect it's AI and

15:19
not really like that. But let's say a fifth of

15:21
the close rate of the human sales rep. But more

15:24
importantly, on the website, instead of having to book in

15:26
a call and a slot with a human sales rep,

15:28
people can just book a call immediately with 24 7

15:31
availability and start talking immediately to someone about about the

15:35
products and services that they offer. And of course, you

15:37
can handle unlimited concurrent calls. So once you build the

15:39
system, it can kinda scale to as many live calls

15:42
as you need. And there's essentially a 1 time setup

15:44
plus optimization window, and there would of course be ongoing

15:47
optimization. But you could get it to a point where

15:49
you're like, I'm happy with how this is working now.

15:50
Our leads are kind of all roughly the same, and

15:52
you can get it to a point where you are

15:54
happy with it or your client is happy with it.

15:55
And so it's clear that on a 1 to 1

15:57
basis, the AI sales rep performs much worse than a

15:59
human. Right? It's 5 percent versus 25 percent close rate.

16:02
However, if you're putting it into the context of a

16:04
bustling business, this can change things a lot. So let's

16:07
say we have a business that's receiving 10000 monthly website

16:10
visitors. So this is through their booking page, their landing

16:12
page, whatever they're driving traffic to to book in calls

16:14
for their product or service. Traditional process using the human

16:17
sales rep is gonna have 10000 website visitors. You might

16:20
book 5 percent of those, the conversion rate of 5

16:22
percent on the landing page. So you get 500 calls

16:25
booked a month and the deals closed is based on

16:27
the 25 percent close rate of the sales rep, the

16:29
human 1. And you're getting a hundred and 25 deals

16:31
at a thousand dollars a piece. That's a hundred and

16:33
25000 dollars. The commission for the sales reps is 15

16:37
percent which is gonna be 18 grand in commissions. And

16:39
then for fulfillment of this, say for every thousand dollar

16:42
deal, you have to pay 30 percent of that for

16:44
your fulfillment and any other operating costs. Then you get

16:46
down to your profit of being 68750

16:50
dollars. Now with the AI sales rep in there, we

16:53
have the same website visitors but because we allow immediate

16:56
booking and they don't have to wait maybe a day

16:58
or 2 to get on a call,

17:00
they can just press call immediately. We could say we're

17:02
jumping up to 20 percent call booking rate of those

17:05
visitors, meaning we go from 500

17:07
calls to 2000 calls. And even based off this, you're

17:10
gonna get a a show rate of maybe 60, 75

17:14
percent. So the actual calls taken is gonna be even

17:16
lower than that. But here you're getting, you could maybe

17:19
have this at 15 but you're still gonna be getting

17:21
a ton of calls that actually end up happening because

17:23
people are gonna book. Well, they're not even gonna book.

17:25
They're just gonna pick up the phone straight away and

17:27
call them. Meaning that you're not gonna have a drop

17:29
off between booked and show. And so, say 20 percent,

17:31
you're getting 2000 calls out of those 10000 visitors because

17:34
people are gonna immediately hop on the phone with them.

17:36
And out of that, you're gonna close 5 percent of

17:38
those deals because it's less than 25. Remember? A 5

17:40
percent close rate on our AI sales rep. That gives

17:43
us a hundred deals at a thousand dollars, a hundred

17:45
thousand dollars in revenue and our AI sales rep are

17:47
gonna have a commission.

17:49
And this is essentially just the operating cost of the

17:52
like say VAPI usage costs and all of your sort

17:55
of API usage. And the commission is gonna be 1

17:57
percent. That's gonna cost you a thousand bucks to get

17:59
a hundred thousand dollars in revenue. And then you've got

18:01
the same 30 percent cost for fulfillment on that. Bringing

18:04
your profit to 69000

18:06
dollars. Basically, the same as this. It's pretty interesting. Right?

18:08
When you have these changes between like the immediacy of

18:12
the AI system where they can immediately book a call

18:14
because it's always available. It goes back to all these

18:16
benefits that we've talked about. Always being available, always being

18:19
there, giving the same kind of experience. And you, of

18:20
course, can be able to tweak the AI sales rep

18:22
around and get that immediate deployment of changes so that

18:25
you can try to push this up to 6 or

18:26
7. And before you know it, you're making far far

18:28
more than you would have been before. Partially because you're

18:30
not having to pay them so much. Right? Sales reps

18:33
take a lot of money. But we can break this

18:34
down a little bit further here. So how this seemingly

18:36
worse AI system can create comparable or even superior business

18:41
value and outcomes. The key is understanding how different advantages

18:43
compound. So, you've got the volume effect here. When someone

18:46
visits a website, they're much more likely to engage if

18:48
they can talk to someone instantly rather than booking a

18:50
call for days later. That's why the AI system captured

18:53
20 percent of the visitors versus 5 percent willing to

18:56
schedule for a future call. Even with a lower close

18:58
rate, the AI calls a much larger pool of prospects

19:01
at their moment of peak interest. And this is really

19:03
important. There's even like a hidden factor in here that

19:06
goes into this close rate where maybe you're missing out

19:09
on a lot of deals even in this purely due

19:11
to the cool off effect of someone booking and then

19:13
3 days later them hopping on without the same sort

19:15
of enthusiasm. You gotta catch them at that moment. And

19:18
this speed to lead concept, the faster you can get

19:20
to answering or or engaging with a lead, the more

19:22
likely they are to close. There's ridiculous stats on that.

19:25
You can look them up. The cost structure as well.

19:26
Now if you look at our example, the human systems

19:28
are going to have a 15 percent commission structure giving

19:31
away 18000 dollars 750

19:33
in profit of what would have been profit. The AI

19:35
sales reps 1 percent operating costs leave almost everything as

19:39
profit. This near elimination of variable costs is transformative for

19:42
business economics. And there are, as I mentioned, hidden benefits

19:45
as well. The real power of the AI paradox becomes

19:48
clear when we consider

19:49
the indirect advantages for businesses. No recruitment or training costs

19:53
for sales reps. 0 management overhead. No HR administration.

19:57
No team meetings or sales training. No vacation coverage. No

20:00
1 just saying, hey, I'm sick now or I'm going

20:02
away for 2 weeks and I've got to find a

20:04
replacement. No performance management and review and saying, oh, why

20:07
why are you not performing like you used to? We

20:08
need what can what can I do? You're not having

20:10
any commission disputes about who should get paid and who

20:12
shouldn't. You're having no turnover issues.

20:15
So when you think about this from a business owner's

20:17
perspective, would you rather a, manage a large sales team

20:21
with all the complexity of human dynamics,

20:23
varying performance, HR issues, and high actually, this is a

20:27
variable cost because it varies with the, amount of revenue.

20:29
So it's a percentage of your top line. So would

20:31
you rather have this

20:33
or a streamlined system that delivers similar results with minimal

20:36
oversight, predictable performance and almost no operational headaches? And I

20:40
know what I would rather do. So this is why

20:43
the AI paradox is so powerful. What looks like worse

20:46
performance in isolation actually creates a fundamentally better business when

20:49
you consider the complete picture. While the raw numbers might

20:52
be similar, the operational reality is completely different. And this

20:55
is only when considering the early stage that AI technology,

20:58
in this case AI voice agent technology is at right

21:00
now. Soon enough, they will be matching or surpassing humans

21:03
1 to 1, then the real money will be flowing

21:05
to those who invested early. So if you can get

21:07
over onto something like this now

21:10
and your clients can snap onto this, when the technology

21:13
improves, you are right there just to make the slight

21:15
tweaks, tweaks, tweaks. Suddenly,

21:17
your client is making a ludicrous amount more money than

21:19
they would have before

21:21
and all of these extra benefits as well. There's costs

21:23
to being early. Right? But there's also huge costs to

21:26
being late. Being early is is gonna be better in

21:28
this case if you can get yourself or get your

21:30
clients to sort of bite the bullet

21:32
and take some of those downsides in the short term,

21:35
in order to be first to benefit really as the

21:37
technology improves. So what you see when you switch over

21:40
to an AI first system like this, you'll see likely

21:43
a decrease in the conversion rate in this case, but

21:45
you'll also see an increase in call bookings and the

21:47
final profit number seemingly increasing as well. But under the

21:50
surface, what you're getting is smaller teams, less communication,

21:53
less time spent hiring, no team meetings and sales trainings,

21:56
0 management overhead. So you see all this stuff on

21:58
the surface which is, oh, we're getting more calls booked.

22:00
Our conversion rate has gone down. But you're getting all

22:03
of these as well.

22:05
So the key takeaways of this section is that the

22:06
economics of AI automation fundamentally change what's possible in business

22:10
operations.

22:11
These shifts create powerful competitive advantages for early adopters who

22:14
understand how to leverage them effectively. We have cutthroat competition

22:17
with companies constantly seeking for market share and profits in

22:20
a world of limited resources. This is kind of the

22:21
underpinning of the adoption of new technologies within businesses. They're

22:25
all looking for an edge so that they can reduce

22:27
their cost. They can offer them cheaper to clients. They

22:29
can deliver more easily. They can scale faster. Those who

22:32
can deliver more value at lower cost will inevitably win

22:35
customers from their less efficient competitors. This is the underlying

22:38
factor that is pushing businesses to adopt AI. Then we

22:40
have the power of AI automation. Implementing AI systems transform

22:43
business operations through unlimited scale, handling massive volume increases with

22:47
minimal additional cost, near perfect consistency, delivering identical quality 24

22:51
7 across all interactions, and 0 coordination where we eliminate

22:55
the exponential complexity of managing human teams as they grow,

22:58
and global reach being able to serve customers worldwide in

23:01
any language and any time without operational complexity increasing. And

23:05
we covered the AI paradox, which is even when an

23:07
AI performs worse in humans on an individual level, it

23:10
often creates a superior business outcome through the compounding effect

23:14
of the unique advantages of AI like we've been over

23:16
in this section. From higher engagement through instant availability to

23:20
dramatically lower operational costs. And finally, the strategic imperative. Early

23:23
adoption of AI automation isn't just about efficiency, it's about

23:27
fundamentally transforming the business model to capture market share before

23:30
competitors adapt. So, understanding these principles and how AI can

23:33
really drive value for business is crucial in identifying the

23:36
most valuable automation opportunities

23:38
and building a sustainable competitive advantage in this AI first

23:41
future. So, just to go back up to this diagram

23:43
here. You can pause and take a look at that

23:45
here. You can see how the funnel breaks it down.

23:47
You've got website visitors, calls booked, deals closed, revenue, costs,

23:50
net profit. This is kinda like gross profit after taking

23:53
out the commission of the sales reps.
