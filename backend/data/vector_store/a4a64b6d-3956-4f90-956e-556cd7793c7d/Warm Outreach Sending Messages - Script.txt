Everyone. Nico here and welcome to sending messages.

00:04
In this video, we're gonna cover the 3 stages

00:08
of sending warm messages,

00:10
the messaging

00:11
groundwork which is a framework you can leverage,

00:14
Once we've given you all the information you need from

00:17
the stages and the groundwork, we're going to craft your

00:20
messages.

00:21
And lastly, we're gonna go over some metrics for warm

00:24
outreach in relevance to the messages we are going to

00:26
be sending. Unfortunately,

00:28
many AAA owners fall into the trap of treating warm

00:31
outreach like a numbers game, blasting generic messages

00:36
and hoping something sticks.

00:38
That approach might work for cold outreach, but it's a

00:41
surefire way to burn the warm connections.

00:44
This video is all about how to create messages that

00:48
gives you results without burning through connections

00:51
with messages

00:52
no 1 cares about.

00:54
In this video, we'll explore messaging stages which are the

00:58
3 key stages of warm outreach and when to use

01:01
each.

01:02
We're gonna go through messaging setup which is how to

01:05
lay the groundwork before writing messages.

01:08
We're gonna go through how to actually write the messages

01:10
which is a step by step guide to how to

01:13
craft effective messages

01:15
with examples.

01:16
And lastly, we're gonna go through tracking results

01:19
which metrics matter for

01:22
warm outreach success. There are 3 stages of sending messages.

01:26
When it comes to warm outreach,

01:28
your messaging strategy

01:29
should adapt

01:31
based on where you are in the relationship

01:33
journey.

01:35
Let's break down these 3 key stages

01:38
and how to approach each.

01:40
Number 1 is initial contact.

01:42
This is your first outreach to a warm contact where

01:46
the goal is to re establish connection and open a

01:49
dialogue.

01:51
First,

01:52
remind them of your connection.

01:55
Then, reference a shared experience or mutual interest if you

01:59
have it with them.

02:01
Keep it light and conversational

02:03
and end it with an easy to respond to question.

02:06
So first,

02:08
an example of how to use this appropriately

02:11
is, thanks for the dinner the other day. How did

02:14
the sales meeting you talked about go?

02:17
Our only goal here is, as we talked about, establish

02:20
the connection and open a dialogue.

02:23
Okay? So the only sole goal is to open that

02:25
conversation with something relevant.

02:28
It's not called outreach where it's like, I saw your

02:30
company did this. Can I sell you this? It's not.

02:33
This is personal connections. It's warm context. Right? So whatever

02:36
you can reference is what you want to be putting

02:38
into the message with the goal of having an easy

02:40
to respond to question. This is

02:43
stage number 1.

02:45
Stage number 2 is following up with people.

02:48
This stage occurs after your initial message

02:52
until

02:52
they actually respond to you.

02:54
If they didn't respond, don't take it personally.

02:57
They might and probably will be busy.

03:01
Tough life. You want to provide

03:03
additional value in each follow-up.

03:06
This is absolutely crucial and it's a mistake I've talked

03:09
about in the cold outreach section where people don't tend

03:12
to add value in their follow ups. It's kinda just

03:14
like, hey, did you see this? That does not work.

03:17
You shouldn't do that with these valuable warm contacts.

03:20
Provide value in each follow-up.

03:23
Value is an extremely broad term. If you are unsure

03:27
about or you can't remember what the broad term value

03:31
really means, you need to go back into the outreach

03:34
theory video in the foundations module and rewatch that. Because

03:38
in there, we speak about the broad term of value

03:41
and what that actually means, which is exactly what you

03:44
need to be putting into your follow

03:46
ups. And then you also want to vary the communication

03:48
channels if they don't respond. It could be email. It

03:51
could be LinkedIn. It could be SMS. It could be

03:53
giving them a phone call, etcetera.

03:55
Multiple channel approach on these warm leads if you can.

03:58
And then you want to space out your follow ups

04:00
appropriately.

04:01
If they are a really busy business owner that is

04:04
in a high season, you don't want to follow-up and

04:06
bother them 1 time a day because they're gonna hate

04:09
you.

04:10
You want to consider

04:11
how busy is this person and how frequent can I

04:14
follow-up without him getting angry at me? And an example

04:16
of a message you could send as a follow-up is

04:18
knowing you're busy with x, y, and z, anything I

04:21
can do to give you a hand? It's a very

04:23
casual approach of following up and providing value with your

04:26
message,

04:26
saying I'd love to give you a hand, and providing

04:29
value by making sure or showing that you listen and

04:31
do your research by referencing something specific.

04:34
Know you're busy with a high season, with the storm

04:36
weather, anything I can do to give you a hand.

04:38
Now you're bumping your message up by default. This is

04:41
something we've talked about before so I'm not gonna go

04:43
deep into it, but this is the approach that you

04:46
want to have as a follow-up message.

04:49
And then we've got the third stage which is what

04:51
we call for nurturing.

04:52
This is the ongoing process of maintaining and strengthening

04:56
the relationship.

04:57
It's between them replying

04:59
and them becoming a client.

05:02
They've replied but have not become a client yet. They're

05:04
in the nurturing stage. What you want to think about

05:06
here is you want to share content that aligns with

05:09
their interests or challenges.

05:11
You can offer help or resources

05:13
without

05:15
expecting

05:16
immediate returns,

05:17
provide value.

05:19
You can engage with their social media content or congratulate

05:22
them on achievements.

05:24
And you can periodically

05:25
suggest low pressure catch up

05:28
or calls. What this basically means, in an essence, is

05:32
you want to stay top of mind.

05:34
You want to make sure this person sees you and

05:37
have you in the back of your mind. These are

05:40
the strategies to do so. And an example of this

05:43
could be, thanks so much for the meeting the other

05:45
day. Have you had a chance to show Jenna yet?

05:48
If they said that we're going to show Jenna on

05:50
the meeting, that's what we could do. Because this is

05:52
again after they have responded so they've told us something

05:55
in relevance to what we've talked about. Another example for

05:58
this is came across this study on how this other

06:01
marketing company, Leveraged AI, thought you might benefit from it

06:04
and you send it to them. Another example is maybe

06:07
they make a post on social media about a client

06:10
achievement or a campaign they've done or something they have

06:12
achieved, comment on their post, and congratulate them on it.

06:16
If they regularly post, you can like their post to

06:18
make sure you frequently show up in their feed, etcetera.

06:21
These are the steps you want to take in the

06:22
nurturing process. Now we're getting down to what we call

06:25
for the messaging groundwork.

06:28
Before we dive into the specifics of creating messages for

06:31
warm outreach, it's crucial to understand the groundwork that needs

06:35
to be laid. If you haven't already watched the Outbound

06:39
Systems Foundations module,

06:41
we

06:42
strongly

06:43
recommend you go back and review it right now. These

06:47
strategies we'll discuss here builds upon concepts we've already covered,

06:51
so if you haven't watched or understood what we actually

06:54
talked about in that module,

06:55
a lot of this is not really gonna make sense

06:57
to you.

06:58
Step number 1 of laying the messaging groundwork

07:01
is identify your connection point. This will often be used

07:05
as an introduction

07:06
in the messages we send to the warm connection.

07:09
How do you know each other? What experience have you

07:12
shared?

07:13
And what mutual interests do you have? Is there anything

07:16
in these 3 questions,

07:17
it usually will be 90 percent of the time if

07:19
they're a warm connection, that you can leverage?

07:22
Step number 2 is you need to assess your relationship

07:25
level. Your relationship with the person you're reaching out to

07:28
is an extremely valuable tool that decides a lot of

07:30
things in your approach.

07:32
This will be used to determine what you're going to

07:34
offer them and what we're going to ask for in

07:37
return

07:38
as well as how you frame your outreach.

07:40
When it comes to what you're gonna offer them and

07:42
what you're gonna ask for in return, this plays upon

07:45
the last video where we talked about setting your objective.

07:48
However,

07:49
how you know them is also going to be a

07:52
part in how you frame your outreach, what you say,

07:55
how you say it, how long you make it, how

07:56
short you write it, etcetera.

07:59
You want to consider 3 things here. Is it a

08:01
close friend

08:03
or a casual long term acquaintance?

08:05
Is it a professional relationship

08:07
or a personal connection?

08:09
And is it a recent interaction

08:11
or is it a long time no contact kind of

08:14
relationship? These are the 3 questions you need to assess

08:16
on a relationship level to be able to understand the

08:19
framework we're about to go through

08:21
and the templates we're going to apply to it.

08:23
Last thing we need to consider

08:26
on the groundwork section is you need to find the

08:29
most relevant conversation

08:30
starter. It could be a recent event or achievement

08:34
in their life slash career

08:36
depending on is this a professional relationship? You might wanna

08:38
reference a career goal. Is it a personal connection? You

08:41
might wanna refer to a life achievement. Right?

08:45
Do you have a shared memory or

08:48
inside joke that you could use to rekindle this conversation?

08:51
And is there a current trend in your mutual field

08:54
of interest?

08:55
Maybe you're both interested in football

08:57
and the team you're with just won a cup. That's

09:00
something you could reference. Did you have a chance to

09:02
watch the cup this weekend? Did you have a chance

09:04
to see this happening? Etcetera.

09:06
This could be mutual interest in terms of business and

09:09
personal life again depending on professional relationship with this versus

09:13
personal connection. Once you think about these 3 concepts

09:16
and have them in mind, similar to the previous video

09:19
where we talked about setting your objective where it's gonna

09:21
take a bit of time when you're starting out, this

09:23
is the same case. The first couple of times you

09:26
do this, it might take a second to get into

09:28
the groove and you might need 20, 30, 40 messages

09:31
to actually get in the groove of this. But as

09:33
you keep doing that and as you send a lot

09:35
of these messages, they're gonna be automatically popping into your

09:38
brain as you train your brain to automatically think about

09:42
these every time you reach out. So in the start,

09:44
these might take a minute but after a while, you're

09:47
gonna get really accustomed to actually thinking about them automatically

09:50
and you're gonna automatically think like, oh, I should send

09:53
this person this because of this this and this. So

09:55
this is a practice thing. It will take a bit

09:57
of time in the start which is completely fine, but

10:00
the more you do it the quicker you will get

10:02
at it.

10:03
And then we're gonna be crafting

10:05
our message.

10:06
Now crafting the perfect warm outreach message

10:10
is an art that combines personalization,

10:13
value, and strategic engagement.

10:15
By following these Hormozi inspired steps,

10:18
you'll create messages

10:20
that resonate with your contacts,

10:22
spark meaningful conversations and open doors to new opportunities for

10:26
your AAA business.

10:28
So here's how we're gonna put this all together

10:31
in a craft your message framework section.

10:34
First thing you're gonna do is you're gonna research and

10:36
personalize.

10:38
This plays into the section up here. We're talking about

10:40
the groundwork. Right?

10:42
You're gonna take 30 to 60 seconds to review the

10:44
person's profiles, online profiles. You're gonna find commonalities,

10:47
recent achievements, or shared interests,

10:50
and then you're gonna identify a specific point to acknowledge

10:53
about them.

10:55
This is going to be the start.

10:57
Then we're gonna apply this to what is the ACA

11:00
framework. It's acknowledge, compliment, and ask.

11:04
The first thing we're going to do is we're gonna

11:06
recognize something specific

11:08
about the recipient.

11:10
This plays into the research we've just done. Right? Recent

11:13
achievements, shared interests,

11:15
maybe something that we

11:17
had an inside joke about, etcetera.

11:20
And then we're going to compliment them is the second

11:22
section which is offer a genuine compliment

11:25
tied to a positive character trait. This needs to be

11:29
a genuine compliment people can see right through in genuine

11:33
compliments which is gonna really really backfire on you. So

11:36
it needs to be a genuine compliment.

11:38
And then you're gonna

11:40
ask. Pause a question to engage them further and show

11:43
interest.

11:43
This is what we talked about earlier where we want

11:46
to spark that conversation

11:47
with an easy to answer question

11:50
and this is the ask.

11:52
Now when you're crafting your message,

11:55
there's a couple of things you absolutely need to follow.

11:59
Using these frameworks we've talked about here is all great,

12:03
but if you don't follow these, it's not gonna perform

12:05
as well as it should have.

12:07
Number 1 is use simple language.

12:11
You need to aim for a fifth grader reading level.

12:15
I can guarantee you that you will not sound smarter

12:20
by using language your prospects don't understand. You will get

12:23
ignored.

12:24
So throw your ego out the window

12:26
and keep things to a fifth grade reading level.

12:31
The reality of this that a lot of people don't

12:33
realize

12:34
is the simpler

12:36
you're able to explain something,

12:38
the better you actually know it. Everyone tries to sound

12:41
very fancy when they do all of this, which is

12:44
a major mistake.

12:46
Fifth grade reading level. Okay? And then focus on providing

12:50
value upfront rather than selling. This goes back to everything

12:54
we've talked about throughout the outbound systems foundations module. It

12:57
goes back to what we talked about earlier in this

12:59
section where we just want to spark that initial thing

13:01
and we want to consider our objective. Right?

13:04
Our objective does not have to be selling. Our objective

13:06
again, starting a relationship, sparking a conversation, etcetera. So focus

13:09
on providing upfront value rather than actually selling them on

13:12
something.

13:13
These are valuable connections where you should spend your time.

13:16
And then keep it concise and easy to read. It's

13:19
really really easy to get carried away when you're writing

13:21
a message and make it a massive massive book to

13:25
read.

13:26
That is a problem.

13:27
You need to keep it short,

13:29
concise, and easy to read for the person you're sending

13:32
it to.

13:33
The more concise you're able to keep it and the

13:35
easier it is to read, the more likely they are

13:38
to read the whole thing, understand what you're asking, and

13:41
therefore respond. And lastly, include a soft call to action

13:44
or ask for a referral, don't direct sell. This is

13:46
something we've talked about a ton throughout these videos.

13:50
And especially true with warm contacts is that you want

13:54
just a simple soft call to action to spark a

13:56
conversation, not do you wanna buy my services. Okay? And

14:00
then we've got something called the message library documents.

14:04
The message library

14:05
contains

14:06
full sequences

14:07
for 5 common warm outreach scenarios

14:11
from initial contacts

14:13
through the follow ups.

14:15
Each template

14:17
shows you exactly

14:18
how to use the ACA framework

14:21
with real examples.

14:24
This document is updated and kept up to date so

14:27
you can go in here, access the document, and have

14:30
a look at what we're covering in here to look

14:33
for inspiration

14:34
and template. So this is a brief look at what

14:36
the warm outreach message library looks like. We've got an

14:39
about section here and then we've got 5 different examples

14:43
for different scenarios

14:44
where you might have 1 of your warm connections. This

14:47
will get you a full understanding

14:49
of different scenarios where you'd use different type of messaging

14:52
and what you would send. I'm not gonna spend your

14:55
time going through all of these but this is a

14:57
document that we're gonna keep up to date with the

14:59
market so you can always go into here and read

15:01
through the examples and take inspiration

15:03
for what you're looking to accomplish.

15:06
Now metrics for warm outreach.

15:09
There are many metrics we can track when it comes

15:12
to your outreach.

15:14
If you haven't already seen the outreach theory video where

15:18
we explain all of them yet, make sure to go

15:21
watch that first. Taking into consideration what we've talked about

15:24
in the outbound systems foundations module, there are 2 main

15:28
metrics we need to worry about as KPIs.

15:31
The rest is used for troubleshooting only in warm outreach.

15:36
Number 1 is response rates which is automatically calculated in

15:40
your warm contact tracker spreadsheet. We've already gone through that

15:43
so you know there's another sheet on the bottom called

15:45
dashboard where you can look at all the metrics. And

15:48
as long as you track everything accordingly and correctly, you're

15:50
going to get your response rates automatically tracked. And you

15:54
want to aim for a 30 to 40 percent reply

15:56
rate initially with these warm contacts. This is definitely not

16:00
the case for cold outreach.

16:02
And the second is meeting conversions,

16:05
which you track in your deal pipeline Trello board and

16:09
it is how many interested leads agree to meetings. A

16:12
bit of a reminder here is that once you get

16:15
an interested reply, you're gonna move them from the warm

16:17
contact tracker

16:18
to the Trello

16:20
deal pipeline board,

16:23
which is where you get to see how many interested

16:25
replies turn into meetings. You want to aim for 50

16:29
percent of your positive replies turning into meetings, meaning half

16:33
the people who reply interested and are in Trello

16:36
should move on to the next stages.

16:39
And a pro tip here is keep it simple.

16:42
Focus on getting responses and booking meetings.

16:46
Everything else will fall in place if you're following the

16:49
messaging frameworks we've covered above.

16:52
2 KPIs you need to worry about:

16:54
response rates and meeting conversions.

16:57
Now a bit of a summary. This video has shown

16:59
you how to craft warm outreach messages that get responses

17:03
without burning valuable connections. Your success with warm outreach

17:07
depends on how well you apply the knowledge you now

17:11
have access to.

17:12
Now a couple of key takeaways.

17:14
Message success depends on matching your approach to the right

17:18
relationship stage that we talked about initially, which is initial

17:21
contact, follow-up, or nurturing.

17:23
Thorough pre messaging groundwork, which is connection points,

17:26
relationship assessments, conversation starters

17:29
is a non negotiable

17:31
if you want high response rates and it should be

17:33
applied even if you don't want them. And the ACA

17:36
framework turns generic outreach into engaging

17:39
conversations that prospects

17:41
actually want to respond to, which is built by Alex

17:44
or Mosey.

17:45
And lastly,

17:46
messaging templates,

17:48
when properly personalized,

17:50
strike the perfect balance between efficiency and authenticity.

17:54
Use

17:55
the message library document

17:58
for examples

17:59
and inspiration.

18:01
This is like anything else in the entire world. If

18:04
you think you can copy that 1 message and just

18:07
apply it, it's not gonna work because you're not putting

18:10
in that touch and the knowledge you've now learned.

18:12
We talked about you need to find a commonality. We

18:15
talked about all the steps you need to take to

18:17
get there and if you just grab 1 of the

18:19
examples

18:20
and don't apply those steps, it's not gonna work the

18:23
way you want it to.

18:24
Like anything in the world, you need to customize it.

18:27
So use the frameworks and the knowledge you've been taught,

18:30
and use the message library

18:32
for examples and inspiration.

18:34
Now there's a couple of actionable steps I want you

18:36
to take afterwards in this video. Number 1 is go

18:39
through the templates.

18:40
Go through the message library

18:42
and understand

18:44
what good messaging using the ACA framework looks like. You

18:48
want to understand

18:50
and familiarize

18:51
your brain

18:52
with what good messages looks like so you have a

18:55
reference point.

18:57
Now number 2 here is send messages.

19:00
Spooky,

19:01
exciting,

19:02
scary, I get it, but you're going to pick your

19:05
top 10

19:06
highest priority contacts

19:09
from the warm outreach tracker

19:11
and write up 10 messages

19:14
to send by carefully following

19:17
the groundwork section of this document first,

19:21
then the craft your message section

19:24
to get a step by step guide on how to

19:27
make your messages.

19:29
Once you're happy with the message you've ended up with,

19:31
start sending and tracking this in the spreadsheet.

19:35
Remember

19:36
you can use the templates in the message library document

19:40
for inspiration.

19:41
So again you're gonna send 10 messages and the steps

19:44
to get here is carefully following the groundwork section of

19:48
this document first,

19:49
then you're gonna follow the craft your messages section and

19:52
use the message library document for inspiration

19:55
to actually create your message. Once you're happy with the

19:59
message you've ended up with and you can conclude that

20:01
this is good, I would respond to this if I

20:03
was in this person's shoes, you send it. In the

20:06
next document called endless warm outreach,

20:09
we'll dive into message amounts and daily habits.

20:13
You'll learn your specific outreach targets,

20:16
when to hit them and most importantly

20:19
how to make sure you never run out of people

20:22
to reach out to.

20:23
Before you watch that video,

20:25
make sure to go through the templates and send 10

20:27
messages and then I'll see you in the next document.
