00:01
Alrighty. So last but not least is an agent built

00:04
on my own software. So I didn't want to make

00:07
this. It's not about me selling you or getting to

00:08
use my software. So I thought I'd put it at

00:10
the end just so you know that I wasn't really.

00:11
This is about you guys learning, and my software happens

00:14
to help you put an agent onto what's at very,

00:16
very easily. So that's why it's included in here. But

00:18
again, this is non sponsored, non promoted, none whatever. I'm

00:21
just really trying to share with you what I think

00:23
is a really valuable skill set to have. Alright. Now

00:25
getting into AI agent build number 4, this is going

00:28
to be

00:30
ta da, a WhatsApp based AI customer support and lead

00:33
generation agent built on AgenTiv,

00:35
my software. So this is a no code, AI agent

00:38
builder that is built on top of OpenAI's assistance API.

00:41
So you're technically using your OpenAI account, getting very, very

00:44
cheaper rates on the, token usage that you're running through

00:47
this agent. But Agenntiv just allows you to build on

00:49
top of it very easily, but more importantly to deploy

00:52
these agents, not just onto web chat widgets like we've

00:54
done with Voiceflow, but easily onto things like WhatsApp and

00:57
Instagram, etcetera. That's really the key thing that Agento focuses

01:00
on doing right now is making it easy for you

01:02
to get your agents onto these platforms. So as you

01:04
can see, it's a fairly similar build to what we

01:06
just did on Voiceflow in terms of functionality.

01:08
We're going to be having a,

01:10
a knowledge base that we can ask questions over. It's

01:12
going to be able to generate another instant quote. So

01:14
we'll just quickly connect that same relevance tool here. And

01:17
finally, we're gonna do a lead capture, but this time

01:19
it's gonna be done through Airtable. So I wanna mix

01:21
it up and show you how you can connect your

01:23
agents to Airtable, which is a very, very common integration

01:25
that you're gonna need to know. And the difference between

01:27
this agent, you're gonna see that it's much, much faster

01:29
to build. This is not meant to be a side

01:32
by side comparison of what's better, how much faster. It's

01:34
just that when you build on a more conversational based,

01:38
AI agent platform like Adjentive, which is built on top

01:40
of the assistance API,

01:42
it's a very different way of building agents because it's

01:43
all just based on a prompt and providing the right

01:45
tools and all the magic kinda happens itself through the

01:48
prompt, whereas VoiceFlow gives you a lot more control. So

01:50
it's really difference between structured AI agent building versus, more

01:54
conversational and open ended chats through, more chat GPT like

01:58
experience that can just go on and on and on,

02:00
which is what these agents can do. So the purpose

02:02
is, of course, fairly similar, but the value of this

02:04
is slightly different in that we are using WhatsApp. So,

02:07
many people browsing for services online are hesitant to use

02:10
website contact forms or other or chatbots that they think

02:12
are not gonna give them access to a real human

02:14
due to the potential delays that come from it. Right?

02:16
You land in a website and you're you're shopping around

02:19
for a different service or product, and then there's this

02:21
this contact form or there's a a web chat widget

02:23
and you're gonna go, oh, well, I don't really think

02:25
I'm gonna get the help that I really need here

02:26
at the at the speed that I want. So you

02:28
might look for a WhatsApp widget. And you know that

02:30
if you click that WhatsApp widget, you're gonna get to

02:32
speak directly to someone. And this is kinda playing on

02:34
that fact that if you have the WhatsApp option on

02:36
your, website, people are much more likely to just click

02:39
that and go through and try to have a conversation

02:41
directly to get what they want. So by having a

02:43
WhatsApp option on a website or other triggers, e. G.

02:45
You can have a QR code that you could stick

02:47
on, say, a real estate sign, and you build an

02:49
agent connected to it or WhatsApp number like we're gonna

02:51
do here. And then you create a QR code that

02:53
people can scan and immediately open WhatsApp and start chatting

02:56
with it. There's lots of different ways that you can

02:58
have an access point into a WhatsApp agent like this.

03:01
But it basically opens up more conversations through a more

03:04
smartphone native platform so they can hop on their phone

03:06
and sort of have a chat away to it rather

03:07
than being on a website on the computer or a

03:09
little tiny website chatbot on their phone.

03:12
In order to essentially engage more prospects or more people

03:15
interested in the business in conversation,

03:18
quickly provide value through either the knowledge base and these

03:21
tools here and real time quotes. And ultimately, because you're

03:23
providing that instant value and instant feedback from them, collect

03:26
their lead information, or better yet, even set appointments through

03:29
WhatsApp, which you can build on a Gentive. But that

03:31
use case a little bit more advanced and not something

03:33
I can show within this video. But it definitely is

03:35
possible. But it's really only a few steps away from

03:37
the skills that you've learned in this video so fast.

03:39
So keep an eye on that appointment setting use case

03:41
because if you can do that with AI agents, it's

03:43
a very, very valuable 1. And I've done other videos

03:45
on the channel here showing you how to do

03:48
that. So the usage of this is that they're gonna

03:49
find the, company's WhatsApp number on their website or elsewhere,

03:53
maybe QR code like I said, and they're gonna start

03:55
a conversation on WhatsApp. And then the agent is immediately

03:57
gonna jump in and start responding and be able to

03:59
ask for the knowledge base, generate quotes, and then capture

04:02
the lead lead information. So without further ado, let's jump

04:04
into building this agent. So we can click up here

04:06
to go to my website, Adjentive. You can click on

04:09
register now. You can just register with your Google account.

04:11
I'm gonna log in with mine.

04:16
It is free to make an account and we have

04:18
a free plan so you can just experiment around as

04:19
much as you need. And then you're only gonna be

04:21
charged based on the amount of usage you use. So

04:23
it's very very cheap and affordable. And I wanted to

04:25
make this platform for you guys to all get on

04:27
and experiment with building AI agents without coding. That was

04:29
really the the core of why we started this whole

04:31
thing. So we've got the dashboard here, which will load

04:34
in my data in a second.

04:36
So you can see here what the dashboard will look

04:38
like when you've got your own agents running. We are

04:40
running the Agenntiv customer support chatbot through this,

04:43
through this account that I'm I'm using right now. So

04:45
you can see usage cost is very cheap sessions, etcetera.

04:48
So it's really cool when you go into analytics and

04:50
you can use Adjentive to see how people are using

04:52
your agents, but that's obviously something for a little bit

04:54
later once you put these into production.

04:56
Now what we're gonna do is, of course, we can

04:58
go to agents or we can just create an agent

04:59
from here.

05:00
And I call this,

05:02
Connor's cleaning

05:04
WhatsApp

05:05
agent.

05:06
Let me go on the screen as well. Answers questions

05:09
from KB provides real time.

05:17
So answers questions from the knowledge base, provides real time

05:20
cleaning quotes, and can capture leads to Airtable. So you're

05:23
gonna see the setup is a lot faster than some

05:25
of these other platforms. You know, I'm not I'm not

05:27
trying to gas myself up here. It's just a different

05:29
way of approaching, building agents. So it's a lot more

05:32
fast and and rapid prototyping and easy to get things

05:34
up and running. Of course, if you need much more

05:36
advanced functionality, you do need to go the extra mile

05:38
and go on to platforms like Voiceflow. But in this

05:40
case, we have a prompt. Very easy. We have a

05:42
knowledge and we have tools. So remember when we went

05:44
back to being

05:46
a a chef and the 3 ingredients concept? These are

05:48
your 3 ingredients. Right? The prompt that you get to

05:50
provide as the instructions, the knowledge that you provide as

05:53
the external knowledge base, and the tools that we can

05:55
connect to it as well, and we can select the

05:57
model here. So I think I want a nice and

05:59
snappy response time because this is gonna be on WhatsApp

06:02
and customer facing. So I'll go to GPT 4 0

06:05
Mini. So it's nice and quick. Now we can just

06:07
put a test test in there. What you are a

06:09
help.

06:13
Just put that in there for now as the prompt.

06:15
The knowledge base, we can turn this on. We can

06:17
create a new knowledge base. Call this Conors.

06:24
We're gonna click here, and we're going to upload that

06:26
same file that we used on Voiceflow, the same document

06:28
that will be available in the resources for this, for

06:31
this particular guide. Give that a second to process. Once

06:33
this goes green, we're good to upload it, and you

06:35
can add multiple files in here. We allowed 5 files

06:37
at a time. You can add dozens and dozens of

06:39
files so you have a massive knowledge base to work

06:41
with.

06:44
And just like that, we have connected our knowledge base.

06:47
And the cool thing about Agentive is because we're built

06:49
on the assistance API. This is actually an independent knowledge

06:51
base. So you can create a knowledge base and connect

06:53
it to multiple different agents. The the knowledge is not

06:56
restricted to the agent that you built it within. So

06:58
I can go and create a new agent and connect

06:59
this exact same knowledge base, and I have all of

07:01
these other ones here. And then when we go into

07:03
the tool section, we are going to have 2 tools

07:04
with this. Well, the knowledge base, if you go back

07:06
to our Figma here, technically, the knowledge base is a

07:09
form of tool that the agent is using. But on,

07:12
platforms like the assistance API and and many platforms, you'll

07:15
see knowledge treated as its own thing. But essentially, it

07:17
is just another tool that the agent is using at

07:19
the right time when it needs to pull in knowledge

07:22
to answer questions. So OpenAI separates it out into its

07:25
own thing here and then so do we because we

07:26
build on top of it. So we do have 3

07:28
different tools, but knowledge is its own tool that gets

07:31
set up through this knowledge base, connection that we just

07:34
made before. Then we have the tools. And here we

07:36
have our instant quote from relevance, and we have our

07:39
capture lead information. So we know the process of going

07:41
on to relevance, so we can just go, create a

07:43
new tool here. And this is going to show you

07:45
a schema. Remember back to when we talked about schemas?

07:48
It explains to the agent how to use the tool.

07:50
So to add a tool to this agent, we need

07:52
to add a schema to it. And thankfully, our buddies

07:55
at Relevance

07:56
AI provide a very, very easy way to create schemas

07:58
to import into agents like Onigento. So here I can

08:01
grab that same cost estimate tool for the instant quotation

08:03
for cleaning services that we've used previously. Again, this will

08:06
be linked. You can just clone this if you haven't

08:08
got it already. I will provide a link for you

08:10
to clone this into your relevant account that will be

08:12
in the resources for this video. And it's just like

08:14
the previous tutorial that we did where it's got property

08:16
type, square footage, and then LLM step here to calculate

08:19
it. It's gonna spit that back and we're going to

08:21
turn that into a nice response,

08:23
with our agent on a agent. We can make sure

08:25
that we've saved this. So the cool thing here is

08:27
that in order to get this connected to Agentive and

08:29
our agent over there, we can just go to custom

08:32
actions here on the tools page.

08:34
As you can see here, it's mainly intended for use

08:36
with OpenAI's custom GPTs, which you can get access through

08:39
ChatGPT. And I highly recommend you do check out the

08:41
OpenAI GPTs because it's a super simple way to spin

08:44
up your own agents, on the ChatGPT site. And so

08:46
we can select our tool here and we can get

08:48
a schema for it. But what I've just realized is

08:50
that I actually do have an Airtable lead capture tool

08:52
here that I've already created on relevance. And it's actually

08:54
gonna be easier for us to set it up here

08:56
on relevance than to have to do it all separately.

08:58
So let's just quickly set that up now.

09:00
If we go Airtable,

09:03
just get a simple 1 that captures the name and

09:05
phone. I'll provide the template for this tool so you

09:07
can clone it in. But basically, it takes an input

09:09
of the name of the lead and the email address

09:11
of the lead and the phone as well. So it's

09:13
capturing all 3 of these as lead information, and then

09:16
it's sending it over to Airtable, which we're gonna set

09:18
up just now. And it's using a post request to

09:21
push that data that we collected here, and we will

09:23
collect through WhatsApp eventually, and it's pushing it into the

09:26
Airtable database. So let's get that set up quickly. If

09:29
you go to Airtable,

09:34
and I'm just going to use a dummy CRM that

09:36
I use for all of these tutorials and you guys

09:37
are gonna be able to clone this if you want.

09:39
And the resources for this video, there will be a

09:41
link like this. If I share this,

09:43
share publicly,

09:47
you guys will get something that looks a bit like

09:49
this.

09:50
And this button up here says copy base that will

09:52
copy it into your account. So what you need to

09:54
do to copy this Airtable base is to create an

09:56
Airtable account and then click on this copy base and

09:58
it'll copy it over. So you can get this with

10:00
the columns all pre set up. It is fairly easy

10:02
to set up these fields yourself, but I wanna make

10:04
it easier for you guys. So you can just copy

10:05
this. It'll be included in the resources. But here we

10:07
have the fields that we're looking for. So now all

10:09
we need to do to send data into this database

10:12
through our WhatsApp based agent. So when someone provides the

10:15
details that it gets shot into here is we need

10:17
to go and see our details for the Airtable web

10:20
API. So Airtable has their own API, which allows us

10:23
to interact with our databases like this programmatically. So all

10:26
we need to do is go up to the right

10:27
hand corner here, go to BuilderHub.

10:29
And if we go to the developer docs here

10:31
and scroll down to the web API,

10:35
This is a reference to the Airtable web API. So

10:37
this documentation is essentially gonna tell us how to interact

10:39
with our Airtable programmatically through our agents and through voice

10:43
flow and through relevance and and through, Agentive as well.

10:45
So any way you want to interact with it, you

10:47
can now take this knowledge that you've gained in this

10:49
video, look through this, and model what we're gonna do

10:51
here in relevance. You can take that same idea and

10:53
put it into, say, Voiceflow, and you can build an

10:55
Airtable integration within Voiceflow yourself where you can send and

10:58
pull data. So these skills all stack on top of

11:00
each other, and it really centers around understanding how APIs

11:03
work and that comes down to reading documentation as well.

11:05
So in this case, if you go back to our

11:08
relevance tool here, we need to get our URL, which

11:11
is our endpoint, which we've talked about before. This is

11:13
the address that we're sending the request to. And Adjentive,

11:16
where we're build an agent, is gonna be using relevance

11:19
to call Airtable. That's a bit of a a roundabout

11:21
way of doing things. But to get all of this

11:23
information, the easiest way is to go back to this

11:25
documentation.

11:26
And the easiest way for us to find the information

11:28
that allows us to interact with our own Airtable base

11:31
that we're setting up is to come down here and

11:33
find the base that you've just cloned into your account,

11:35
which will likely be Smith's Solar CRM. Don't worry about

11:38
the name. And Airtable does a really, really good job

11:40
of making this super easy. And then we can just

11:42
come here to the leads table. So if we go

11:44
back to,

11:45
Airtable here,

11:47
you see see we are on the leads table. We

11:48
have these different tabs. You can just ignore. These are

11:50
just different projects that I've done on YouTube. They're all

11:53
kinda there in case people are also cloning this into

11:55
their account. But we're looking at the leads tab here.

11:57
So we go to the leads here and we want

11:59
to create records. And then it gives us all of

12:01
the information we need here in order to create records.

12:04
So, you can see that it's a post request, and

12:07
it's got HTTPS

12:10
and all of this information. So this is the endpoint,

12:12
and we wanna copy all of this all the way

12:14
down to leads. Copy this.

12:16
Go back to, relevance

12:19
and paste this in.

12:21
Oh, maybe that was already there. And paste that in

12:23
there.

12:24
And then we need to add in 2 headers. So

12:26
we have authorization and content type. Now remembering what we

12:28
learned before, you can see we have h and this

12:31
h tag means that there's a header. And so the

12:33
header is authorization,

12:35
and then the value is gonna be bearer and then

12:37
our token. This is something that tripped me up when

12:39
I was first learning this, using APIs is that you

12:43
need to add this bearer word and then a space

12:45
and then your API key. It's a weird way of

12:47
doing things. I don't really know why,

12:49
why it's like that. But sometimes when you're doing these

12:51
authorizations, you need to add in bearer space and then

12:54
your API key. So it's it's there for a reason,

12:57
is what I'm saying. And And then we have the

12:58
content type being application JSON. So we're already familiar with

13:02
that. So going back to relevance, we have the header

13:04
of authorization

13:05
and content type here, application JSON. And now we need

13:08
to add in our Airtable API key so that we

13:10
are authenticated and we have permission to send an API

13:13
request. So they're not gonna let anyone use this details

13:16
and and start sending data to our our database. Right?

13:18
They need to be authenticated.

13:19
And that's what API keys do. So to get our

13:22
Airtable API key, of course, we go to Airtable. We

13:25
can come up to the top right here, go back

13:26
to our builder hub,

13:29
go to personal access tokens,

13:32
and we can create a new token. Call this YouTube.

13:36
We can go,

13:38
add the base. This will be,

13:40
Smith's

13:41
solar CRM. We can add a scope,

13:45
read,

13:47
write. And sometimes I find it handy to have the

13:49
schemas read in there as well. So basically what we're

13:51
doing here is saying that I give this API key

13:53
that we're creating permission to interact with this,

13:56
this Airtable, and I give it permissions to do these

13:58
things like read what's in the database, write to the

14:01
databases, and create new things, and also to see the

14:03
overall structure of the base and the field types. So

14:06
we can add that and create the token.

14:08
We get this token, head back to relevance. And again,

14:11
this template so that you can clone it into your

14:13
account is going to be on the, on the resources.

14:15
So if you're following along, you should just clone it

14:17
into your account and then come down here and make

14:19
the changes as I do them. So we can add

14:20
a make sure we have a space after bearer and

14:22
then paste our key. Because if we go back to

14:24
the web API docs, we can see we have authorization,

14:27
bearer space, uAPI key, content type, and then application slash

14:31
JSON. And then we have the data as the payload.

14:33
Remember, like, this is what's inside the envelope. Then we

14:35
have records, and we have the field, name, phone, and

14:38
status. And Then it's provided us an example of how

14:40
we would send data into that, which we don't need

14:42
to worry too much about because I've already got this

14:44
fitted in here. This can be quite fiddly. In fact,

14:46
for this, I'm actually going to add another field in

14:49
here.

14:49
This is 1 thing about relevance. I'm not a huge

14:51
fan of this. It can feel super fiddly sometimes.

14:55
So if we go email,

14:59
this will already be in the template that I give

15:00
you by the way. Email.

15:03
Why would that delete that?

15:11
Okay. So we have the URL has been updated. The

15:13
method is post. That's correct. We have the authentication. We

15:16
have the content type. We have the body all set

15:19
up. We've added in our fields of name, phone, and

15:22
email,

15:24
which we have name, email, and phone. So we can

15:26
give it a spin here. If we say Liam,

15:30
here we go.

15:34
And we give it a spin on the tool.

15:38
We'll see if it accepts us.

15:47
Yep. And there we go. If we go back to

15:49
Airtable,

15:51
if we open the base up,

15:53
there we have it. Liam phone email. So we can

15:55
take this tool and we can take the instant quote

15:58
generator. We can put those into,

16:00
agentive. And before you know it, we're gonna have our

16:02
agent ready to go. So let's head back to relevance

16:05
here. We'll save this tool.

16:07
And we'll change this to name, email,

16:10
and phone.

16:11
And just quickly before we do that integration, this is

16:14
when the description comes into play here. Remember those natural

16:17
language descriptions of what the tool does, what each of

16:20
the parameters and inputs are. It's really important to get

16:22
these right and relevance, and I see a lot of

16:24
people skipping over this step. But this is what's gonna

16:26
be put into that schema. Right? So when relevance generates

16:29
a schema for us, that 1 page manual on how

16:31
to use this tool and use the API in order

16:33
to interact with this functionality,

16:36
when we give it into Agenitive, it's gonna be reading

16:38
over everything in there, and it's gonna be those little

16:40
descriptions around what the tool does and what it's supposed

16:43
to take in. And and these parts here relevant is

16:45
where we get to set that up. A proper description

16:47
is needed before we do this integration. So this tool

16:50
captures lead information and stores on the Airtable CRM, requires

16:53
lead's name, phone and email, name, phone and email. The

16:56
name is the name of the lead. Yep. Email email

16:58
address of the lead, and phone is the phone number

17:00
of the lead. So that's all good there

17:03
and ready to integrate.

17:06
Might even do a quick check on the sparkly cost

17:08
estimate as well.

17:12
Yep.

17:14
Type of property, square footage of the property,

17:16
and we are ready to go. So now we can

17:18
click on the custom action step here. Scroll down and

17:21
click on both of these.

17:23
Bam. Bam.

17:27
Scroll down. We're gonna change this to custom auth.

17:30
We're going to generate an API key.

17:34
There we go. And we're going to generate our open

17:36
API, not open AI, open API.

17:38
It's essentially a type of API and a way of

17:40
describing how the API works. And it gives us all

17:43
of this information here. I will actually expand it out

17:45
so you guys can see at least some of it.

17:47
It's probably easier over on a agentive actually. And then

17:50
we head back to a agentive.

17:53
What we can do is paste in the schema.

17:57
And now if we scroll through this quickly, I just

17:58
want you to see what a schema looks like under

18:00
the hood because we have some important parts, that's gonna

18:02
really connect the dots for you after everything that we've

18:04
learned in this video. So I'll zoom in a bit

18:06
here.

18:08
We have the title of the tool. So we have

18:09
a few key things in here that we can break

18:11
down. Basically, the paths. We have 2 paths in here.

18:14
This is 1 of them.

18:15
And this is the other. These represent the 2 tools

18:17
that we are integrating. You can see 1 here is

18:20
the operation ID is basically the name of the tool,

18:23
and that is taken from relevance directly, the Airtable lead

18:25
capture. And and the summary here is the actual name

18:27
or the title of the tool that we had on

18:29
relevance. This is just a a version where they put

18:31
in,

18:32
underscores to connect the, the gaps. And the description here,

18:35
you can see is the same as a description

18:37
that we set up over I don't wanna go back

18:39
on there, but that was a description that we put

18:41
under the name to describe what the tool does. And

18:43
then as for the inputs, relevance has made it a

18:45
little bit more complicated by putting a schema in here.

18:47
So we'll cover that in a second. But basically, here's

18:49
the second tool, sparkly cost estimate. This tool does this

18:53
about estimating the cost of an apartment.

18:55
Then down here, we have the schemas for the inputs.

18:58
So we have, things like the name, this is for

19:00
the lead capture tool. The name,

19:02
which is 1 of the fields, it's gonna be in

19:04
type string and it's required.

19:06
We have the email which is type string which is

19:08
required and we have the email which is a description

19:10
here.

19:12
And of course, you can see all the descriptions that

19:13
we put in on relevance showing up here. Then phone

19:16
number, the lead, the email, the lead, etcetera. And here

19:18
it's specifying specifying

19:20
how the AI agent should be sending inputs into that.

19:22
So that's probably the most difficult technical part of this

19:24
whole video, but I did want to give you a

19:26
bit of context on how that kind of fits together.

19:28
This is quite a complex schema. Relevance puts it together

19:30
in a little bit more complex way, by using these,

19:33
these schemas for the inputs down here. But long story

19:36
short, if we then go to the add auth button,

19:39
we need to set up our authentication,

19:41
which we can do by coming back to relevance and

19:43
copying this.

19:44
We go back to here, paste this in, we go

19:47
custom auth, and we go authorize

19:52
authorization

19:53
with a zed.

19:56
Oh, I need to create the tool. Sorry.

19:58
So we're going to click create tool.

20:01
So the tool has been created successfully.

20:03
And there we go. We have both of the tools

20:05
added in because we did them both in 1 bundle

20:07
on relevance.

20:08
And then if we go edit off, we can then

20:11
put in the API keys for both of these so

20:13
that we have permission to use them.

20:23
And we can do the same for this 1.

20:32
And there we go. Now we have our knowledge set

20:34
up, our 2 tools set up and you can see

20:36
that we're pretty darn close to completing this build. We

20:39
have all of these 3 done.

20:41
Might as well make them green for the sake of

20:42
it. And now the only thing left to do is

20:45
to write a prompt that connects us all together and

20:47
that's really the glue that holds it together. My go

20:49
to method of rapidly creating prompts for AI agents is

20:52
using a relevance tool,

20:54
perfect,

20:57
that I've created. And I I said I'd give this

20:59
to you guys for free as well. That's gonna be

21:00
included in the resources. But if I go to use

21:02
here,

21:04
it's a prompt writer that includes all of the information

21:07
from how we do prompting at Morningside, which is based

21:09
on research and includes all the key things like role,

21:11
task specifics, context,

21:13
explaining how to use the tools that has been provided

21:15
as well. So I'm just gonna fill this out quickly

21:17
here and then get a prompt and you guys can

21:19
steal my prompt from the resources or you can use

21:21
this as well to create your own. But it's a

21:23
pretty good exercise because you can see here we have

21:25
the agent name being.

21:32
And what I like to do here is so this

21:34
is just a quick rundown of what the agent does,

21:36
where it is being deployed, and why.

21:47
So you can pause the video and look at that

21:48
there, but just a bit of context on what the

21:50
agent does, where it is being deployed, and why

21:52
conversions context we can say.

22:04
Knowledge context, we can say.

22:12
Then we get to the tools available section, and we

22:14
can say

22:25
And then we have the other tool, which is

22:35
and then for the ideal input and output examples, I'm

22:38
just gonna say none to provide.

22:42
Frankly, frankly helpful.

22:47
And so just like that, in maybe a few minutes,

22:49
I've typed in all of this information about the agent

22:51
and what it does. And now I can just click

22:53
run tool here,

22:55
and it's going to take all of this information, run

22:56
it through the prompt that I've written that,

22:58
bakes in the best prompting practices for AI agents from

23:01
my experience and from the projects that we do at

23:03
Morningside AI. And also all the research that we've used

23:06
to make those prompting practices. And it's gonna spit us

23:08
out an AI agent prompt that we can throw straight

23:10
into Adjentive, and it'll just glue everything that we've done

23:13
together. Tell it who it is and what it's trying

23:14
to do, tell it how it's supposed to use the

23:16
knowledge base, and tell it how and when it's supposed

23:18
to use those tools in order to reach its objective

23:20
of capturing those leads for us via WhatsApp.

23:23
And there we go. If we scroll down, we can

23:25
see it spit out this entire prompt. I'm gonna change

23:27
it to the raw text. We get all this markdown

23:29
formatting

23:30
included.

23:31
We can view all here.

23:33
I'm gonna copy it all and we're going to take

23:36
it over to,

23:37
Magento here and paste this in. And there we go.

23:40
Act as Connor cleaning, WhatsApp support, and lead generation agent.

23:43
Engage with potential customers on WhatsApp to provide provide potential

23:45
information about our cleaning services. Answer FAQs.

23:49
Answer off instant quotes.

23:52
When pricing inquiries arise, use the instant quote generated tool.

23:55
Tools, you have this tool and this tool.

23:58
Examples, I'm just gonna cut that out for now.

24:01
And then notes.

24:02
So that should be all good. We can start to

24:04
give this a spin here. I am gonna zoom out

24:06
a bit. Alright. So I'm just gonna publish this to

24:08
make sure that everything is baked in.

24:10
Give Give the second, and now we can chat to

24:12
it here. Hey. How's it going?

24:15
I can actually slide this across because I'm in place.

24:19
I want to know where you guys are located.

24:23
There you go. Conner's cleaning is located at x y

24:26
z. So it's obviously using the knowledge base correctly and

24:28
say what what services do you provide?

24:32
And we're not asking about pricing. So it shouldn't go

24:34
for the quote.

24:38
I might try to do it at the end. Yes.

24:40
I see it's asking. If you have any specific requirements,

24:42
need a quote, just let me know. Yeah. Sure. I'd

24:44
like like a quote.

24:46
Boom. I need the property type and square footage. It's

24:48
a house and it's 1000 square feet.

24:52
So Now the agent is trying to trigger that tool

24:54
by taking the house and taking the 1000 and then

24:57
putting them into the relevance tool based off what the

24:59
schemers told it how to use the API. It's gonna

25:01
go grab that from relevance, send it back to us,

25:03
and there we go.

25:05
Here are the quotes for you.

25:06
If you interested in any specific further service and need

25:08
assistance, just let me know. I can also help you

25:10
with booking. Now here, I would probably change the prompt

25:13
and make it a bit more forceful and say, send

25:15
me like like, let's go to the next step right

25:17
now. But for now, it's good enough. We can

25:20
say, sure I'd like to book a deep clean. And

25:23
that should ask me for my lead information.

25:27
K.

25:28
Huge Jacqueline.

25:30
This is the name.

25:32
This is the phone. And huge at jack jackman

25:36
is email.

25:38
We should be able to see if we go back

25:40
to our handy dandy air table here.

25:43
Huge popping up here.

25:46
Oh.

25:55
Bang. And huge jackman is in the

25:58
CRM here. It does say that it's booked. I would

26:01
play around the prompt a little bit more to be

26:02
like, hey. Look. This is just

26:04
setting up the next step for someone to call them

26:06
and book in the service. But you can also do

26:08
appointment setting through agenda as well. Again, like I said,

26:10
it's a little bit more advanced than what we want

26:11
to do here. But as you can see, this is

26:14
a a very different way of approaching building agents because

26:17
you tell it you basically provide all of the ingredients

26:19
and use that kind of chef's approach, the knowledge and

26:21
the tools, and you connect it all up. And you

26:23
make sure the tools have well described schemas so they

26:25
know how to use it and they know when to

26:26
trigger them. The knowledge base has been included in the

26:29
prompt, and also the tools as well have been included

26:31
in the prompt, telling it how and when to use

26:33
it. It's really a much faster way of building agents

26:35
from the high level prompting,

26:37
and then people are just asking and having sort of

26:39
a free flowing conversation with it. Okay. And just quickly

26:41
before we go to the step of putting it onto

26:42
WhatsApp, which won't take long at all, I do want

26:44
to show you how you can debug and when you're

26:46
working in a agentive.

26:47
It's helpful to know when tools are being triggered and

26:49
why. So for example, if we go into the transcripts

26:52
here and we look at this big transcript here with

26:54
14 messages that we just had. Hey, how's it going?

26:57
Rada Rada Rada. We can see here it's using the

27:00
tools and we can hover over it. We can see

27:02
it's calling the tool with the URL. It's a post

27:04
method and we can see the data here. I'll just

27:07
zoom in on that. The property type and the square

27:09
footage that was sent away to relevance are here. So

27:12
if you're having issues with your tools or it's giving

27:14
weird responses,

27:15
you can either come in here to the transcripts after

27:17
the fact. So say maybe this is on WhatsApp,

27:20
and something's going wrong or customers are getting upset. You

27:23
can come into the transcripts here and pick through and

27:25
see what's going wrong with the tools. And just like

27:27
down here as well, the lead capture, we can see

27:29
the name, email, and phone were all put into this

27:31
request and sent away to Relevance AI, and then onto

27:34
Airtable as a second step.

27:35
And you can also see the output as well. So

27:38
the output of the tool

27:39
is all in here. It's basically just giving us a

27:41
confirmation back from Airtable that, yep, everything went well. And

27:44
up here, you can see the output

27:48
as, the response with the deep cleaning estimates and stuff

27:51
like that. You can see it a lot more easily

27:53
if we say, hey. Can I get a quote?

27:58
K. And if you give this a second, once it's

28:00
finished generating, agenda will then pop up this show usage

28:03
and bang there. In the editor here, you can then

28:05
debug, okay, how many tokens are being used, How much

28:07
is this costing? What was the model?

28:09
Etcetera. And then you can see the tools input here,

28:12
apartment 500 square feet, etcetera, and the output as well.

28:15
So it's really easy to debug those tools while you're

28:17
in Agenntiv. Let's make sure that we've published this.

28:20
I'm gonna publish it again. In Agenntiv, we do have

28:23
version history. So if you do publish it and you

28:24
want to roll back or look at how you had

28:26
it set up previously, you can now see that I've

28:28
got 2 versions, v 1 here. And I just took

28:30
away this little full stop here. And you can see

28:32
that that's I've changed the prompts. You can update it

28:34
over time. You can make edits within a here. And

28:37
test, test, test. And then when you're ready to push

28:39
that to production and basically,

28:41
if we had this on a WhatsApp agent

28:43
and say I published this connected to WhatsApp and it

28:45
was working, and then I looked to the the transcripts

28:47
and something wasn't quite how I liked it. I could

28:49
come in here and make edits and then test, test,

28:51
test. And then when I was ready to publish it,

28:53
I'd click publish and then it's gonna push those live

28:55
to the agents. You're not gonna mess things up by

28:57
playing around with things on here. So the final step

28:59
is, of course, to deploy it to WhatsApp.

29:04
Go to the deploy tab here. You can then click

29:06
connect WhatsApp.

29:10
I'm gonna click continue.

29:12
Get started. You will of course need a Facebook business

29:14
manager to set up this integration fully. That's free with

29:17
every Facebook account. So if you haven't got 1 already,

29:19
I'll leave a link in the description so that you

29:20
can set it up, takes a few clicks. Then you

29:22
will see this page here and you can select the

29:23
business manager you've created. In this case, I'll be using

29:26
this testing 1. And then you'll be able to set

29:27
up a new WhatsApp business account

29:29
which I can click here. I'll go next. Set up

29:31
a business account name.

29:34
And then this is the display name

29:36
for the business.

29:38
And we're gonna call this a a retail business.

29:41
Now you need to provide the phone number that you

29:43
want to connect your agent to. Unfortunately, you can't have

29:45
your own personal WhatsApp number and also have a business

29:48
account running through it. So you could need to either

29:50
buy another SIM card or borrow a friend's number who

29:52
doesn't have WhatsApp, etcetera. In this case, I'll be using

29:54
a spare number that I have. Then they're going to

29:56
send you a verification code to your number, which you

29:58
have to enter in, and then you should see the

30:00
screen once you've successfully passed that verification.

30:02
So I'm gonna continue. It's verifying our information for a

30:05
second.

30:07
And now our agent is connected to that phone number

30:08
and we're ready to give it a test. So if

30:10
we go finish here,

30:11
there's 1 more thing that we need to do on

30:13
a Gentiff, which is to click this. Yours may say

30:15
not registered. Don't worry. You can just click this checkbox

30:17
here and click confirm.

30:19
Give it a second to connect.

30:21
Now Now we've successfully connected our agent to that WhatsApp

30:23
number. Now thing here is this interval. If you're not

30:26
sure what the interval is, you can read this tool

30:28
to appear. And if you're done with the deployment and

30:29
you wanna remove it from that number, you can always

30:31
come back and click deactivate deployment here. But all that's

30:33
left to do now is to test our functionality. Righto.

30:35
So I have it taken to my phone here, so

30:37
I'm just gonna show you a little bit of a

30:39
on screen here of me creating this contact and having

30:41
a message with it. So the number that I set

30:43
up, I can create a new contact, and then I

30:45
can send them a message. Hey.

30:51
And you can see on screen here, it says this

30:52
is the business using a secure service from Meta. So

30:55
this means this is the business account, as we've connected

30:57
it through our WhatsApp, business profile that we set up

31:00
before.

31:02
And there we go, we get a message back. Hello.

31:03
Thank you for sharing your information. How can I assist

31:05
you today?

31:06
If you have any questions about cleaning service or need

31:08
a quote, feel free to let me know, so I

31:10
can say,

31:11
yes, a quote. Let's ask a question to the knowledge

31:14
base. Where are you based?

31:20
There we go. We are based in the greater Boston

31:22
area, and it's giving me the,

31:23
the correct location there. So we can go for the

31:25
lead capture now. So if we say,

31:28
I'd like a quote.

31:35
So property type,

31:37
it's a house

31:38
that is about

31:41
800

31:42
square feet.

31:47
There we go. We're getting the, estimations and our quote

31:50
back. It's asking if we're interested in any of these

31:52
services. I'd say, yes. I'd like the

31:55
deep

31:56
cleaning please.

32:00
Now it should ask me for my contact information.

32:04
There we go, so Liam, Liam,

32:06
come

32:07
on.

32:10
Then we should see it appear over here on our

32:13
SmartSolar CRM.

32:15
And boom, there it is. So we've got everything done.

32:17
That is just 1 run through of using this WhatsApp

32:20
agent. But as you can see the the messages don't

32:23
come back instantly so it feels like it is like

32:26
it's actually could be a real human they're applying and

32:28
it's giving just clear information

32:30
right through WhatsApp. Imagine you are reaching out to maybe

32:32
book an accommodation or you're reaching out to a cleaning

32:35
service like this or you're reaching out to any kind

32:37
of business and you want some real information directly from

32:39
what feels like a person

32:40
and then you also have the function of getting a

32:42
real quote of I mean a great use case for

32:45
this kind of thing like barbers, like I say if

32:46
you you message a barber on Whatsapp, maybe you're

32:49
in Europe somewhere in South America or in Central America

32:52
or and and you want to go to a barber

32:53
and this is a common issue that I've run into

32:56
when I'm traveling. It's like I want to message this

32:57
barber but I might not speak the language that grow

33:00
up and then if you message them in English, it

33:02
will be able to handle that in in English as

33:04
well as in Spanish or in Portuguese or wherever you

33:06
are. So this kind of functionality built through WhatsApp is

33:08
a really really great use case for you guys to

33:09
pick up, which is why I wanted to teach you

33:11
guys it. And we can also go back to Agenntiv

33:13
here.

33:14
And if we go to our transcripts for this agent,

33:17
we can see the 1 for today is here. So

33:19
12 messages. You can go through the entire transcript, and

33:21
you can see it's calling the quote tool here. We

33:23
see all the information that went in and out of

33:25
it, and then we see the Airtable lead capture information

33:27
as well, input and output. So that is how you

33:29
use a Gentif, my software, for building these WhatsApp based

33:32
and also other deployments as well. So if we go

33:34
to studio, we go to deploy, we have Instagram as

33:37
well. So via our mini chat template, you can hook

33:39
into Instagram and do appointment searches and things on Instagram.

33:41
You can go through Messenger if you wanna run some

33:43
Facebook lead ads to Messenger, through voice flow as well,

33:46
Telegram, Discord, we have integrations with everything you need as

33:48
well.

33:49
So that's the end of this build. I hope you

33:51
enjoyed, and this is a super handy use case, and

33:53
and deployment really for your AI.
