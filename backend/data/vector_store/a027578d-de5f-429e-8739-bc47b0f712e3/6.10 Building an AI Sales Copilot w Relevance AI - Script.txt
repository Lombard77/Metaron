00:01
And so what I've done is put together a big

00:03
Figma board here, which is gonna be breaking out all

00:04
these different builds. So under here, there's some goodies. You

00:06
see, oh, 0, there's some goodies under each of these

00:09
that I've put together, and we're gonna go through them

00:11
1 by 1, starting off with agent 1 over here.

00:13
I mean, there's a lot of stuff here, that you

00:15
guys are gonna get. So you'll get the whole Figma,

00:17
and it includes all of the templates. So if you

00:19
do wanna just kinda watch through this, pick it up,

00:21
you can either do it and follow it step by

00:22
step with me and see how I build and really

00:24
build those flexible skills that you're gonna need to succeed

00:27
in this space. Or you can just watch it and

00:29
be like, okay. I kinda get what he's doing and

00:31
then take all the templates from me at the end.

00:33
That's, I mean, completely up to you. Depends if you

00:35
wanna be a really, really nerdy builder about it and

00:37
get into the weeds like like I like to do,

00:39
or you just wanna be like, hey. I wanna do

00:41
this in my business. I wanna roughly understand how these

00:43
things work and what platform.

00:45
So use this resource as you will, but we're gonna

00:46
jump into agent build number 1 here, which is our

00:49
sales copilot built with relevance AI. So running through this

00:53
quickly, we have the purpose of this. This is basically

00:55
gonna look a bit like this. It's gonna be a

00:57
Copilot and Copilot's work and that you have a,

01:00
it's basically a specific

01:02
AI agent that you build for a specific staff or

01:04
staffing role. So say, in this case, it's gonna be

01:06
a sales Copilot.

01:08
It'd be the thing that the sales rep uses to,

01:11
in their day to day as they're working on their

01:13
jobs. So you can add tools. Like, in this case,

01:15
you see we're going to have 3 different tools here

01:17
for our agent. One's gonna be a company researcher tool.

01:19
So this is when the sales rep would be like,

01:21
hey. Oh, I have a call coming up soon. Let's

01:23
put on this I need to research this company because

01:25
this is who I'm gonna be on a call with.

01:27
So they'll put in the company URL. This tool that

01:29
we're gonna create is gonna go and research that company.

01:31
It's gonna bring back and give a summary. And then

01:33
it's like, okay. Well, this is the LinkedIn URL of

01:34
the person that we're going to be I got on

01:36
a call shortly. It's gonna pass in the LinkedIn URL.

01:39
It was going to take that URL. It's gonna pull

01:41
all the information and write a summary about the person.

01:42
So now we have the company summary and we have

01:44
the person summary. And the final step here is gonna

01:47
be what I'm calling a pre call reports generator, and

01:49
that's gonna take both that company and prospect research that

01:52
we've done. It's gonna combine them together and be for

01:55
the specific company as you're going to see that this

01:57
hypothetical company we're building the sales copilot for.

02:01
It's gonna generate a basically, a pre call report or

02:03
a strategy,

02:04
a strategy prep for the sales rep so that they

02:06
go into those calls much more prepared and also

02:09
sort of a personalized guide on how to try to

02:11
close this person. So,

02:13
all of these templates are gonna be here. Each of

02:15
these are templates for the tools, and this is for

02:17
the agent as well.

02:19
But here's some more information. You guys can pick through

02:21
this as you wish, but, this is the kinda end

02:23
result, and we're gonna be able to chat to it.

02:24
And this would be something you could build for a

02:26
client. You could build it for your own business, or

02:28
you could just tinker around. You could build Copilot like

02:30
this on relevance for yourself. So that's why I wanted

02:32
to start with relevance because it also is a platform

02:34
that we can build these tools on. So it's a

02:36
really, really good 1 to start with, and let's get

02:38
into it. So the first step, of course, is to

02:40
go to Relevance AI. So I'll put a little link

02:41
up here. You guys be able to get this Figma.

02:43
It'll be on the school. All of the information and

02:45
all the resources for this are gonna be like, this

02:47
Figma is gonna be linked to the school, my free

02:49
school community, if you haven't already joined. Joined. Biggest AI

02:51
community on school. Biggest AI business

02:54
community probably in the whole world.

02:56
So we can jump across that first thing in the

02:58
description. You'll be able to find this in the YouTube

02:59
resources section.

03:01
Pretty straightforward. Of course, when you click on this, it's

03:03
gonna ask you to log in to Relevance. So if

03:05
you haven't already, you can make an account.

03:07
It's fairly low cost. They have a a free plan

03:09
and then a Teams plan, I believe. So it's not

03:11
too much. But then there's a really, really valuable tool

03:13
as you're gonna see. So you can assign in here.

03:16
I'm gonna jump in with my

03:18
Google account. Account. There may be a bit of setup

03:20
for your account, but I'm sure you guys are smart

03:21
enough to figure out how to set up an account.

03:23
I'm sure Relevance also makes it easy enough. So then

03:25
we get taken to this dashboard, but we see on

03:27
this left hand side, we have tools. So these are

03:29
the tools that I've talked about, where it's some kind

03:31
of functionality that we can create, and we can build

03:33
it all on relevance. No code, and there's even sort

03:36
of extensibility, or you can add more functionality

03:39
into relevance by adding some low code components or even

03:41
custom code. So relevance is a really great base for

03:43
building not only tools, but but then the agents that

03:46
you can connect that into. And we're gonna use the

03:47
same relevance tools that we make now in multiple of

03:50
the different agents that I'm gonna make for the rest

03:51
of this video. So first things first, if we go

03:53
back to the Figma here, we see we need to

03:54
make 3 different tools. So tool 1 is company researcher.

03:57
It's gonna take in a company URL. It's gonna search

03:59
the web, and it's gonna return a summary. So that's

04:02
the functionality we need. Let's go and create a new

04:05
tool. Gonna call this, research company. We can give it

04:08
a cool little I'm gonna zoom this up for you

04:11
guys. Hopefully, Hopefully, that's the right

04:14
size.

04:15
Search.

04:17
Have fun with this stuff, guys. I can if it's

04:19
putting stupid emojis on things to to enjoy it, then

04:21
then that's what you need to do. Like,

04:24
if you make it a chore, it's gonna feel like

04:25
a chore. Right? Now we get to descriptions. This is

04:28
something we're gonna see recurring. But basically, as as you

04:30
know, as we learned in the concept section, we need

04:33
to have natural language descriptions of our tools and of

04:36
our APIs so that the agent's gonna read those descriptions

04:39
and understand,

04:40
what the agent or what the tool does and what

04:42
those different parts does. So you'll see this recurring throughout

04:44
this. But first things first, what does this research

04:47
company tool do?

04:49
Takes in oh, my caps lock on.

04:52
Takes,

04:53
and there's also some tutorials here if you wanna go

04:56
deeper. Relevance has some great documentation as well.

04:58
But takes in

05:01
a company

05:03
Penny.

05:06
URL and

05:08
scrapes

05:09
their

05:10
website,

05:11
then

05:12
returns a summary,

05:15
an AI generated

05:17
summary. So then to build a tool, we need to

05:19
have some kind of input. You don't always need an

05:21
input. It can just be triggering. But generally, you're gonna

05:23
have some kind of input that the agent needs to

05:24
pass into the tool. In this case, to research company,

05:27
it's going to need to take in some text, which

05:29
is gonna be a URL.

05:31
We're gonna say,

05:32
com

05:33
company URL.

05:36
And then again, here we have another description. You see?

05:38
Describe how to fill this input. This is again going

05:40
to help our agent within Relevance AI and elsewhere as

05:44
you'll see in tutorial number 4, why this is so

05:46
important to add in the descriptions right. So this is

05:50
a u,

05:52
URL for a company

05:54
to be researched

05:57
must be in the format

06:00
h t t p s colon slash slash dot

06:06
dot dot dot. So we need to have the h

06:08
t t p s for this to work. So that's

06:10
gonna be our input. Now if this seems a bit

06:12
confusing, just stick with me. It will make sense in

06:13
a second. This stuff if there's anything that I've learned

06:16
from picking up so many different tools, like when I

06:18
first got into Facebook ads, when I've got into building

06:20
these kinds of agents, and so you feel completely overwhelmed,

06:22
but that's all just part of the process. And what

06:24
feels difficult now is not gonna feel difficult forever, so

06:27
just please stick with me. And it's a really, really

06:29
great feeling once you go and be like, this was

06:31
hard a few weeks ago, and now it's really easy.

06:33
So we've got our first input. That's what the research

06:36
company tool is gonna do, and then we need to

06:38
define our steps. So the next step, we can go

06:40
add I'm gonna hide this so we get a bit

06:42
more space. Add step. Now the cool thing about relevance

06:44
is that it comes with a lot of great functionality

06:47
out of the box. Here's 1, extract website content. We

06:50
have LLMs. We have Google searching. We have all sorts

06:53
of AI generations, replicate

06:56
knowledge bases as well. There's so much cool stuff on

06:58
here, and this is why I really rate Relevance as

07:00
1 of the best platforms. If you were to go

07:02
all in and want to upskill, you can build so

07:04
much on this. So I'm a big fan, and I

07:07
love the the Relevance team and

07:08
what they're doing. So the initial plan for this build,

07:10
I was going to use the extract website content, which

07:13
is fully straightforward. We can say oh, 1 other thing.

07:16
The company URL, we are going to be using this

07:18
company URL throughout our tool here. So we can change

07:21
this text to say something more descriptive. So company,

07:25
underscore u u

07:27
URL. You guys are gonna gonna think like think and

07:29
write like code is now because you need to, use

07:31
some kind of syntax and use some kind of variable

07:33
naming convention. This is a a standard 1. Or you

07:36
can do things like company

07:38
URL camel case, but I prefer this format as a

07:41
I'm I'm mainly a Python kind of guy myself. Now

07:43
that we have that named, we can use it in

07:44
these kinds of, fields. So here you can see it

07:46
pops up user inputs. So, basically, when this tool is

07:49
run, it's gonna take the inputs or the information we

07:51
put in the inputs, and it's gonna pass it to

07:53
different steps and use them as we describe within the

07:56
within the builder here. So let's run this quickly. Let's

07:58
put in, my company, h t t p

08:01
s slash slash more

08:03
mornings dot a I,

08:07
and then we can click,

08:09
run

08:10
here. So that's gonna go to my website and scrape

08:13
the information off of it.

08:15
There we go. So it's got all of this,

08:18
but you see it's just pulling back the first page.

08:21
And this is why I actually I shuffled this around,

08:23
and I wanna show you guys how to do something

08:25
a bit more advanced. I know this is supposed to

08:26
be a beginner tutorial, but this is not really that

08:29
useful. And I it's a very easy thing for me

08:31
to just bump this up to a little bit more

08:33
valuable. While relevance tool here is great, we can do

08:35
better. So we're actually gonna delete this.

08:39
You can use that step for all sorts of other

08:40
things, but I really like what's called

08:44
Firecrawl.

08:45
Firecrawl

08:46
Firecrawl web scraper.

08:48
This is a cool app,

08:50
Firecrawl

08:51
dot dev. Shout out to the guys at Firecrawl. Basically,

08:53
if we then go h c d oh, let's just

08:55
see if they can do it. Morning side

08:58
dot hi.

09:00
And they'll do a free scrape for us here.

09:03
So this is just going to do the single URL

09:05
just like we got in relevance. But the difference here

09:08
is if we could then go

09:09
to crawl,

09:11
if you hover over this, it's gonna crawl a URL

09:13
and all of its accessible sub pages outputting the content

09:16
from each page. So instead of just taking that front

09:18
page, it's actually gonna crawl through multiple things. So this

09:20
is really

09:21
the first cool thing or or first skill that I

09:23
wanna put in your tool belt is that you have

09:25
things like Firecore that you can use to relevance. They

09:27
have things like map, which is just gonna output all

09:29
the URLs that it finds. And there's other things here

09:31
where you can use AI to extract data. I'm not

09:33
gonna go into that. But what we want is this

09:35
crawling functionality

09:36
from FireCrawl. So I'll put a link in on the

09:38
school post that comes with this video. It'll again, first

09:40
link in description to go to the school. And if

09:42
you go to the YouTube resources section,

09:44
there will be a, a whole post on this and

09:47
all the resources will be in there. It'll also be

09:49
in my free course on school as well. So you

09:51
can find it in the classroom section.

09:53
So you wanna sign up to Firepool so you can

09:55
get API key. It's very easy. We can just go

09:57
through with Google. Again, this is not sponsored. There's

10:00
0 sponsoring going on through any of these tools. I

10:02
guess I'm kind of sponsoring my own tool because I'm

10:04
putting it at the end, but I'm not getting paid

10:05
a dime for this. I'm really just trying to put

10:07
you guys on what I like to use, what's made

10:09
me money, what's made me a more valuable

10:11
AI automation,

10:13
expert or developer, for my companies and for the companies

10:15
you work with.

10:17
Continue, and then you get to the dashboard here. Here.

10:19
Might look a bit scary, but what you can do

10:20
is go to the API keys. So you can click

10:22
on create an API key here.

10:24
YouTube.

10:26
I'm having issues with mine. It should be fine for

10:28
you. I've already got an API key. But once you

10:29
get the API key, what you can do is take

10:31
it and come back here to relevance,

10:34
And you can go into the side panel here. Where

10:36
is it? Settings.

10:38
And then we have our API key. So we're gonna

10:40
need to add more into this later, so keep an

10:41
eye on this. This is something you need to be

10:43
familiar with.

10:44
And you can scroll down to fire FireCrawl and you

10:46
just pop it into this FireCrawl API key section here

10:49
and you're good to go. And you can come back.

10:51
Oh, no, we don't wanna duplicate that.

10:55
Now we've got our FireCrawl set up. We need to

10:57
make a couple of things. We need to do a

10:59
couple of tweaks here. We have, of course, the if

11:02
you want to get those variables up, we can go

11:04
bracket bracket,

11:05
or or curly bracket curly bracket, which is shift, to

11:08
get those. I don't know why it's not popping up.

11:11
There we go, company URL. And if we hover over

11:13
this, we can see it says scrape the provided URL

11:15
only. Uncheck if we want to crawl instead. So if

11:17
we want to get that crawl functionality that we just

11:19
saw, that we think we want, to get all the

11:21
data, we can, uncheck it.

11:25
And then we want to extract the main content. So

11:28
you might have to just trust me on that 1

11:29
that we don't wanna have all of the other rubbish.

11:31
We just want the body of the website.

11:33
A number of pages, we don't want this to take

11:34
too long. You can expand this much more, but I'm

11:37
just gonna go for, say 5 for now just to

11:39
keep it quick.

11:43
And then now what we can do is run this

11:45
again. We've still got my URL up here. We can

11:47
go run step.

11:50
Give it a second. You will at some point have

11:52
to pay FireCrawl. Of course, it's not a free service,

11:54
but they do have a free plan, so you should

11:55
have no issues with getting that. So here you can

11:57
see we're getting a lot more data back from this

11:58
web scrape than we were with just the relevance version,

12:01
which is great. So the next step is we have

12:03
this data. We want to generate some kind of research

12:05
summary,

12:06
so that we can send that to our sales rep

12:08
once they have, requested it. So now it gets into

12:10
the fun part of writing LLM prompts. For this 1,

12:14
sometimes you need to really go and and make a

12:16
big effort, which we are going to do later as

12:18
you'll see. But in this case, we just want a

12:20
quick summary. I'm gonna throw 1 in here that I

12:21
made earlier. All of this will be available on the

12:23
Figma or it'll be given somewhere in the resources. Alright?

12:25
But, we just need something quick and dirty here. It's

12:28
not really a massive part of the project, so it's

12:30
okay to just whack 1 in there. So, bang, I've

12:31
got it in there. Can you please take this website

12:33
content and summarize it into a 300 word natural language

12:36
summary, which clearly outlines

12:37
where they're based, their values, etcetera. Anything that will be

12:40
helpful to know for a sales rep, we'll soon be

12:41
on a call with them. Break into key areas like

12:44
overview, products and services team, etcetera. And I've got a

12:46
couple of things here to make sure that it doesn't,

12:48
mess up, which I I was doing for me a

12:49
bit in testing. So, we do want to put in

12:52
if we go curly bracket curly bracket, we want to

12:54
put in the file called data here, which is gonna

12:56
be, all the website data that came back from our

12:59
scrape. We want to then insert it into this prompt

13:01
here. So I hope you're starting to the things in

13:02
your e cogs and your brain are starting to click

13:04
into gear here, and then we get to select the

13:06
model. For this, it's pretty basic task, so I want

13:08
something quick and cheap.

13:10
For many of you, it's gonna be easiest to work

13:11
with the OpenAI APIs because you probably already played around

13:14
with your API key before, which I'll show you how

13:16
to do in a second. But let's go with GPT

13:18
4 0 Mini, but Relevance, of course, does have support

13:20
for all of,

13:22
the other models. But my tendency for most tasks now

13:24
is to actually go for some of the Google models

13:26
that have come out. Again, you guys might be watching

13:28
this in a year or whatever. It might be quite

13:29
different. But at the moment, Google is really leading the

13:32
way with making the cheapest models possible, and they're actually

13:35
really good as well. The the price decrease on using

13:37
things like, Google Gemini Flashlight and Google Gemini Flash 2

13:41
and stuff like that, it's ridiculously cheap, and it's also

13:43
a really good model. So it's a bit more difficult

13:45
to get APIs on the Google side. I'm just gonna

13:47
stick with OpenAI for this tutorial. So let's go g

13:49
p t 4 0 many, and then we need to,

13:51
of course, set up our API key. If you scroll

13:53
down, where is the OpenAI?

13:55
So to get your OpenAI API key, you need to

13:58
go platform dot open a I dot com dot playground

14:01
slash slash playground. Sorry. This will again be linked in

14:03
the resources or you can just type up platform dot

14:05
open a I dot com. I'm sure you'll find it.

14:07
If you haven't already created an account,

14:09
and sign in, and then you need to go to

14:11
your dashboard here. You go on the left side, you

14:13
go to API keys and you click create a new

14:14
secret key. And then you're gonna be able to copy

14:14
that key and bring it back into,

14:16
secret key, and then you're gonna be able to copy

14:18
that key and bring it back into,

14:20
relevance, paste it in here, and then you're good to

14:22
go and start using the OpenAI suite of models. It's

14:24
pretty easy, right? So now we have our information back

14:27
from the scrape. We have our prompt in here,

14:30
and then we can go run step and see what

14:33
this company research tool is gonna output for us. Boom.

14:35
MorningSight AI is a leading artificial intelligence development company dedicated

14:38
to empowering businesses.

14:40
Autonomous AI agent development, enterprise consulting, chatbot development team.

14:44
They got

14:46
keep me out of my own team page down, but,

14:49
yeah. So there you go. That's the that's the company

14:50
research tool. That's step 1. I hope you guys can

14:53
kinda see how that works now. A cool thing about

14:55
relevance is Eris' build section, section, which we've just gone

14:57
through, but you can also go to use. And this

14:59
can be really helpful when sharing these kinds of tools.

15:01
So not this is not really only just an AI

15:02
agent tutorial. I'm also teaching how to build tools because

15:05
you can build very valuable tools in something like relevance.

15:07
And then you can go share.

15:09
You can go publicly available.

15:13
Oh, and I can click this, and then I can

15:15
give to my employees. I can give to the companies

15:18
that I'm working with, the the clients that I've I've

15:20
solved these kind of services on, and then they get

15:21
a nice and handy tool like this. I mean, I

15:23
use these throughout my organization for, like, description generation, a

15:26
lot of content repurposing.

15:27
There's tons and tons of different use cases for building

15:29
these kinds of tools, and then you can take this

15:31
URL and you can share it around to whoever you

15:32
want. So this is a, a great way to use

15:35
relevance. Let's go back to our tool here. But for

15:37
now, we need to keep moving along so we can

15:39
get this this first agent done. So that's the first

15:41
tool. I'm gonna run through it a bit quicker now

15:42
that we know how these kind of tool buildings work.

15:45
I'm going to create a new tool here. I'm going

15:47
to call it this time if we go back to

15:48
our Figma. And I recommend when you guys are building

15:51
your agents, you're building systems and planning them out, this

15:53
kind of laying out in a Figma. If you're not

15:55
familiar, this is Figma. It's like a design software, but

15:57
you can also use it for kind of whiteboarding. It's

15:59
called a FigJam board. It's 1 of the types of,

16:01
boards that you can do. And I use this all

16:03
the time with my team as well. It's like, if

16:05
you can't take what what I'm telling you, lay it

16:08
out on a board so that I can review it

16:10
and give you notes, and and then we all agree

16:12
this is the build. There's often a lot of, communication

16:15
issues with explaining functionality. So this AI agent layout, it's

16:17
really helpful. You can if it's maybe a workflow automation,

16:20
you can do box box, arrow, arrow, arrow, all of

16:22
this, laying out how it's gonna be built. Here, I've

16:24
done it for you in a very basic format. So

16:26
we've done this first 1. Maybe I can just make

16:28
this green.

16:29
Second 1 is gonna be prospect researchers. So this takes

16:31
in a LinkedIn URL,

16:33
searches the web, and returns a summary. And you're gonna

16:35
see how I tie this all into an agent, shortly.

16:39
So we're gonna go research prospect.

16:41
So

16:42
takes in a LinkedIn URL, right, scrapes the profile, and

16:46
then generates

16:47
an AI summary of the prospect.

16:49
Input, we're gonna need a linked in URL,

16:53
the link linked in URL of the prospect.

16:57
Let me rename this.

17:04
Now we're gonna add a step and relevance has got

17:06
us here linked.

17:09
Get a LinkedIn profile or company post.

17:13
So this is cool because then we can pop in

17:16
our LinkedIn URL here.

17:18
Oh, we don't need to.

17:24
So we're gonna get the user profile here. Then if

17:27
I put in mine,

17:31
my LinkedIn profile, if you guys wanna connect with me

17:33
on LinkedIn, more than welcome to do so. I'll put

17:35
in the description below.

17:38
We can can do a little run step here. So

17:40
if we go back over to data here, so that

17:44
that's great. We've got my about section. So this goes

17:46
a very long way across because it's in, it's in

17:48
Chase on here.

17:50
It's got my company. It's got

17:52
my company domain, where I'm from,

17:55
year's company founded, tons and tons of great information that

17:57
you guys can use and we are gonna use shortly.

17:59
So this is really cool. I would probably add 1

18:02
more step to this if I was taking this this,

18:04
and building it for for my own team. I would

18:06
add in another LinkedIn scrape here, where we just do

18:09
the same thing, but it will also get the posts

18:11
because posts can give you a bit more up to

18:12
date, information on what they've been doing recently. But, you

18:15
can guys can add that and you just go add

18:17
a step LinkedIn, and you do the same thing as

18:20
we've done here. But you change this to, LinkedIn

18:23
post get user posts. So that might be a cool

18:25
thing for you guys to add the, functionality on at

18:27
the end as a bit of a challenge. You can

18:28
pause this video and do that. And then we need

18:30
a LLM step to take this. Again, I'm gonna grab

18:33
a pre written prompt that I did just to save

18:35
some time. Gonna drop this in here. Says fairly similar

18:38
stuff.

18:40
LinkedIn

18:41
data.

18:42
I'm just gonna put all the data

18:44
in there.

18:46
And then we're gonna use a GPT 4 and mini

18:48
again,

18:49
and we can give that a run because we've already

18:51
got this data queued up here. And then we go,

18:53
we've got a nice summary.

18:56
If I change this to a nice and formatted, there's

18:59
a little button down there within raw or formatted, and

19:01
you can copy the stuff out of here, of course.

19:03
Slay Motley, my followers, and I got a lot more

19:05
than I thought. So we have the summary, my name,

19:07
where I'm based,

19:08
information,

19:09
my career experience, super handy stuff, and this is gonna

19:12
be super helpful in the next step when we generate

19:14
that pre call report. So very quickly, we've created 1

19:17
more tool. I'm gonna save this. So now we've got

19:20
if we go back to our Figma, we have 2

19:22
of these done. Now the final 1 is gonna take

19:25
in the company and prospect research and generate a pre

19:27
call report. So this one's gonna be a little bit

19:29
different.

19:30
If I go create a new tool,

19:34
pre call report.

19:39
So this is a quick pre call takes in company

19:42
and prospect summary and generates a free call report for

19:45
sales to ratiachize.

19:47
Now for the inputs for this, we need long text,

19:49
much as normal text because we're gonna be taking in

19:51
that big company and, and prospect research. Research. So we

19:55
go prospect

19:56
summary,

19:57
summary of the prospect based on length and

20:00
profile. Yep.

20:04
And a prospect in this case is someone who's a

20:06
potential customer. Just to clarify that if you're new to

20:09
business note when you get these terms. Company summary.

20:13
Summary.

20:19
Right there, we have our prospect summary and company summary,

20:22
and now I hope you're following along. Next step is

20:24
just an LLM step, and we want to combine these

20:26
2 together. Again, I've got a little handy prompt for

20:28
this to save us time. Now in this case, you

20:29
will see that the prompt is a bit bigger. Right?

20:32
So this is, for more important parts when you are

20:34
creating tools, whether it's it's for agents or just generally

20:37
when you're using prompt engineering and LLMs to create value.

20:40
In this case, we are creating value because in this

20:41
case, we're taking in this prospect summary and this company

20:44
summary. And we're also giving the the context of this

20:47
fantasy or or hypothetical business that we are selling this

20:50
agent to as, like, a a copilot system. We've got

20:53
Big Boy Recruit, which is Dallas based recruitment firm specializing

20:56
in software industry talent acquisition for SMBs. You're gonna see

20:59
this kinda recur across the different projects we do. But,

21:01
basically, we're helping these Big Boy recruits to automate their

21:04
business with AI. So this takes in some context on

21:07
that business, and it is going to generate a a

21:09
report that's gonna help the sales rep say, okay. This

21:11
is the company. This is what we sell. This is

21:13
what we specialize in. This is the company that we're

21:15
trying to sell to. This is who we're gonna be

21:16
talking to. What's some how can I personalize this call

21:19
or what's the strategy I can go into this with?

21:21
What are some angles that I can attack this call

21:23
from? And so to do this, I have a prompt

21:25
writing tool that I use quite regularly, and my team

21:28
uses it as well.

21:30
Perfect

21:31
prompt.

21:32
So this tool does a lot of leg work for

21:34
myself and my team all the time. I'm gonna give

21:36
it to you guys to use for free. You'll be

21:37
able to clone it into your Relevance account. Basically, what

21:40
I'll usually do is I'll put on, the dictation thing.

21:42
You've got it on 1 of these keyboards. You've got

21:45
this little

21:46
thing. Basically, whatever on your computer allows you to speak

21:48
into the computer, and it, takes in your voice

21:51
and transcribes it into into text on the screen. I'll

21:54
press that, and then I'll explain, as you can see

21:56
here, what is this prompt doing and why. And I'll

21:57
go, this prompt needs to do this. This is this

21:59
is gonna take in this information. It's gonna do this.

22:01
The reason we're doing this is this, this, this. And

22:03
I'll do, like, a big, big body of text in

22:05
there. And then the next 1, if I have them,

22:07
I'll give some good examples of input and output pairs

22:09
of how I want it to take in data and

22:11
how I want it to spit it out. If you

22:13
give it both of these and you hit run, it's

22:14
gonna print you out using the research backed prompting techniques

22:17
that we use at Morningside. It's all crammed in here.

22:19
There's a video that I recommend all of you watch.

22:21
It's gonna be in the free course anyway on school.

22:23
So when you get in there and watch my prompt

22:25
engineering guide, this is basically the entire information of that

22:27
prompt engineering guide smashed into this LLM step here. So

22:31
when you pass this information in, it applies all of

22:33
that and it gives you out a prompt that is

22:34
fully researched back and performs very, very well right out

22:37
of the box. So that's a little bit of extra

22:38
value I want to throw in there for you guys.

22:40
This is gonna be available on the school,

22:42
with the rest of the resources as well. So basically,

22:44
I put in the information here about what this particular,

22:47
task was. I said it's gonna take in the prospect

22:49
information. It's gonna take in the prospect summary and the

22:51
company information, and it spat out this basically first go,

22:54
and I just had to insert these variables. So this

22:56
prompt and everything else will be on the on the

22:58
score resources as well. So in this case, because we

23:00
are doing a bit of strategy and sort of high

23:01
level thinking rather than just summarizing, and we may wanna

23:04
change the model here to something a bit smarter, we

23:06
could go to o 3 minutei, which is 1 of

23:08
the later ones.

23:09
Again, when you're watching this, it might be 0 0

23:11
6 or o 10 or whatever the hell they come

23:12
up with next. But there's probably gonna be some much

23:15
better models, so just use a smart 1 because it's

23:17
really, strategizing on how big boy recruits can position themselves

23:20
for this call. So enough of me yapping about that.

23:23
Let me grab some inputs for this and we can

23:25
test it. Yep.

23:29
Should I enter your muscle? Alright. So I've got this

23:31
information here about myself, my LinkedIn profile, and my company.

23:34
And so again, remember that this is for Big Boy

23:36
Recruit, a Dallas recruitment firm specialized

23:38
in software industry talent. So it's gonna look at my

23:41
company, Morningside AI. It's gonna look at me and my

23:43
background and my profile on LinkedIn. Then it's going to

23:45
spin as we see here,

23:47
review this, analyze this, map big boys unique value proposition,

23:51
and it's going to try and

23:53
create a report that's gonna allow the sales rep to

23:55
sell me or close me better on there or find

23:57
some angles to sell through at least. So I'll have

23:59
to go run tool. And now you see that I'm

24:00
using a lot of just basic web scraping and LLM

24:03
steps. I just wanna show you guys the basics. The

24:04
thing is tools can get very, very advanced when you

24:06
have, like, CRMs you wanna integrate into, but Relevance allows

24:09
you to do all of that. It's just within the

24:11
scope of tutorial, it can be pretty difficult to be

24:13
pulling information from all over the here because I have

24:15
to set up a database, show you guys how to

24:17
do it too. So this this keeps it quite confined,

24:19
but it still gives you a good taste of it.

24:20
So

24:21
if we look at this view, key business challenges and

24:24
opportunity, Morningside AI, this, Liam's profile, gives me a bit

24:27
of a rundown of this, mapping BigBoy recruit's unique value

24:30
proposition. Maybe it's gonna be better if I change this

24:32
to

24:34
the format.

24:35
There we go. Talks about mapping Big Boy's recruits, strategic

24:38
talking points. I've been following your journey of digital marketing

24:40
AI, rah rah rah rah.

24:42
Dive into opportunity. I work at Big Boy's Dis Assist,

24:44
and it's even gone and done a section on anticipated

24:47
objections.

24:48
So the idea is that the sales rep is gonna

24:49
have a skim of this before the call, which ties

24:52
into the value that I've listed here, which I'm gonna

24:54
do for all of these builds, by the way, which

24:55
comes down to ultimately a better prepared sales rep should

24:58
close more deals. Right? If they know more about the

25:00
prospect and the company and you have an angle to

25:02
try sell through and with suggestions at least, it should

25:04
increase the conversion rate of the sales team. So we've

25:06
built this tool. We can change this to green now.

25:09
And the final step is going to be heading over

25:11
to our agent builder within relevance. I'm gonna save this.

25:14
And if you pop over in the left panel here,

25:16
you can go into our agents.

25:18
And what we wanna do is create a new agent.

25:22
I'm gonna call it

25:24
out sales

25:25
co pilot,

25:28
big boy,

25:31
big boy sales co pilot. Sorry, I got, like I

25:33
said, I gotta have fun with the stuff where I

25:35
go kinda insane.

25:37
This

25:38
this agent

25:39
is

25:41
our sales

25:42
co pilot that helps

25:45
reps to

25:46
be better prepared

25:49
for sales calls.

25:53
Triggers, we don't need to do any of that. We

25:54
go to core instructions.

25:56
I'm gonna again paste in some of the stuff that

25:57
I prepped earlier. So if I paste this in here,

25:59
you'll see that it's structured fairly similarly to the prompt

26:02
that we just did before for the pre call report

26:04
generator. And this is again using another tool that I've

26:07
created,

26:08
for AI agent prompting. So it's fairly similar stuff that

26:11
I I include in that other prompting tool, but the

26:13
agents is slightly different,

26:15
to just regular LLM steps within different tools and workflow

26:18
automations. So I will include this as well. It's my

26:21
AI agent perfect prompt generator, and it's fairly straightforward to

26:24
use. I'll include that in there as well. Basically, you

26:26
put in all the information about what the agent is,

26:28
why it's doing it, different tools that you're connecting to

26:30
it, and then it prints out this for you. So

26:32
I'll just run through it. We've got a role here

26:33
telling it who it is, and kinda hyping it up

26:35
and saying how good it is. Explains the task,

26:38
talking about how it's helping to conduct detailed research on

26:40
companies and prospects,

26:42
some specifics.

26:43
Specifics. Don't need to worry about those too much, just

26:45
reiterating the task. And now here, we can enter in

26:47
the references to tools. So if you go slash tool

26:50
and see in order to get the agent to function

26:52
as well as possible, we need to tell it what

26:54
tools it has available. This is really key across all

26:57
the agents you build, especially if they're more conversational. We

26:59
need to explain to them what tools they have and

27:02
how and when they should use them. So if I

27:04
go, you have 3 powerful tools, research company.

27:09
Yep. That's right. Purpose. Input company URL, use when needing

27:12
to gather company information. This 1 of course is the,

27:15
prospect.

27:19
And then this last 1 is our pre

27:25
There we go. So that's all whacked in there. Don't

27:27
need to worry about that too much. But again, this

27:29
will be included, this prompt and everything, if you wanna

27:31
follow along and also if you just wanna clone the

27:33
whole agent, and use it in your own business or

27:35
sell it or whatever you wanna do. We also get

27:36
to select the model here. I'm just gonna keep it

27:39
as GPT 4 0 Mini. I like some pretty fast

27:41
responses here because agents, as someone's using it, it can

27:44
feel really irritating if it's not responding quickly. So we've

27:47
got all that built out. That's the core instructions and

27:49
the prompt of the agent.

27:51
We can go down to the tools section.

27:55
It's got all the tools connected in here because we

27:56
mentioned them in the prompt. And we can just go

27:58
through and do some quick settings on here. I don't

28:00
wanna have to do an approval for it. Some tools

28:03
you can say, look, they've gotta give it a thumbs

28:05
up before it can actually trigger it. Prompt fail to

28:08
use, just some quick descriptions we can pop in here.

28:10
I'm not sure why relevance doesn't carry that over from

28:12
the tool. I guess they're asking us to do it

28:13
again for some reason. When you need to research a

28:17
prospect

28:19
linked

28:20
in URL,

28:21
we're gonna say this is auto run as well,

28:25
and then pre call,

28:26
changes to auto run as well.

28:29
Use this when you need to

28:31
generate

28:32
a pre

28:33
call report

28:35
from

28:36
the company

28:37
and prospect

28:38
research.

28:41
Alrighty.

28:42
And there's all sorts of other cool stuff. Relevance as

28:44
you can see is like abilities, sub agents, metadata, extra

28:47
stuff that you can put onto, but I just wanna

28:50
get you guys started with the core of this. Alright,

28:52
so we can confirm that.

28:56
And boom, we have our agent here ready to go.

28:58
So this is where you can test your agents and

29:00
use them if you want to. But in this case,

29:02
I'm just gonna give it a quick rundown and say,

29:04
see if the functionality is working as we as we

29:07
planned.

29:08
Hi. I am getting on a call with Liam Otley

29:13
from

29:14
Morningside

29:18
Site AI. Here,

29:19
has

29:20
details.

29:22
Oh, we can just go LinkedIn.

29:37
Get me every call. Report, please. To print forward call.

29:42
Sending your task to big boy sales copilot,

29:45
And then we get to see all the debug and

29:47
how it's actually walking through these different steps.

29:50
Oh, let's see what he does.

29:55
Yep. Okay. That's great. It's using the research company as

29:58
we wanted it to.

30:01
Should add in 1 more step there to research the

30:03
prospect as well.

30:06
There we go. Using the second tool, it has pretty

30:08
satisfying when this stuff works. And this is just a

30:10
really basic 1. Guys, I don't want you to think

30:12
this is like, oh, well, that's pretty underwhelming, Liam. I'm

30:14
trying to teach you the basics so that you can

30:16
actually build on top of this. So if you get

30:18
the bug, if you get the

30:20
like, you get a travel bug, if you get the

30:22
agent bug and you see the stuff and you're really

30:24
interested, oh, look. There it is. Now it's filling out

30:26
the prospect summary as the

30:27
input. Surely we don't have to watch it

30:29
do do that. It's gonna take a while.

30:35
And is it really good? Write that out word for

30:37
word like that. But when you start to see this

30:39
magic and you add in other cool tools and functionality,

30:41
you test it on yourself, you can build like things

30:43
for it. Maybe you wanna do content, you make yourself

30:45
a little content copilot, etcetera.

30:49
Then we go to use all the tools and it

30:50
should be spitting back and bam, there we go. So

30:52
I hope that was worth the wait. Let's go through

30:54
it now. Here's is your comprehensive pre call report for

30:57
your upcoming conversation with Liam Motley from Morningside AI. Pre

30:59
call report,

31:00
talent acquisition under pressure. Morningside AI operates in a highly

31:03
competitive AI and tech market. As I scale, finding specialized

31:06
talent engineers, data scientists, AI. With a proven record can

31:09
be challenging.

31:10
That's scarily accurate because that is literally 1 of the

31:13
biggest constraints that we have had to scaling Morningside long

31:16
term as it which is really, really hard. Even with

31:18
my channel, it's so hard to find the right people

31:20
and get them to commit as as developers as well.

31:22
So if you wanna build a very big general AI

31:25
development firm and AI automation agency, you need the best

31:27
talent and you need to get a lot of it

31:29
in, so that you can scale up. So that's bloody

31:31
spot on. Obviously, this thing knows, that's a good angle

31:34
to sell through.

31:35
But, yeah, prospect analysis, Liam's a dynamic entrepreneur and thought

31:36
leader. But, yeah, prospect analysis analysis leans a dynamic entrepreneur

31:38
and thought leader.

31:40
With a robust background in ecommerce, digital marketing, and AI,

31:43
his journey reflects passion for innovation and commitment to continuous

31:46
learning. Again, that's pretty bloody spot on.

31:49
Hands on experience.

31:51
So there you go. That is the big boy sales

31:53
copilot for big boy recruits. The cool thing you can

31:55
do now once you have built this,

31:57
is you can go share.

32:00
There's a chat UI, which I'm gonna turn on now.

32:02
There are chat widgets, so you can put them on

32:04
websites and stuff like that. What I wanna do is

32:06
just pull this up because this is what you'd be

32:07
giving to your client likely or if you guys are

32:10
gonna start selling these businesses, which, again, we're touching on

32:12
selling in the last section of this video. So how

32:15
do you turn these into into a business and start

32:17
making money from selling these as a as a service

32:19
and building these businesses, which is really where the money's

32:21
money's made. So there you go. This URL, you can

32:23
obviously send to your client. If you're building it for

32:25
your own team, you can send this to your team

32:26
and say, hey. Pin this because you're gonna be able

32:28
to use it. Add more functionality into it, etcetera.

32:31
That is how you build a Copilot on Relevance AI.
