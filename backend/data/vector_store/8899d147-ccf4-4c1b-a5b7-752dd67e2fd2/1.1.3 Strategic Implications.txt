Now getting into the strategic implications of AI adoption. Understanding

00:04
the economics of AI automation isn't just theoretical, it has

00:07
profound implications for how businesses should act today. So as

00:09
an AI automation agency owner, you need to clearly communicate

00:12
the strategic choices businesses face and help them to make

00:15
informed decisions about AI adoption. In this section, we'll be

00:17
examining 2 critical questions. When should businesses invest in AI

00:21
automation? What happens to those who wait? So by understanding

00:23
these dynamics, you'll be better equipped to guide clients through

00:25
what is perhaps the most important strategic decision, whether to

00:28
be an AI leader or follower in their market. Let's

00:30
explore this through the lens of 2 real world but

00:33
hypothetical businesses making choices about AI adoption. So the early

00:36
investment question. Let's talk about what early adoption really means

00:39
with the story of 2 local plumbing companies. These are

00:41
hypothetical of course, they're not real. We don't actually have

00:44
Mike's Plumbing in John's but I'm using it to illustrate,

00:46
the difference when it comes to early investment in AI.

00:49
So we've got Mike and John, Mike's Plumbing and John's

00:51
Premium Plumbing Services. Mike's early mover journey. In early 20

00:55
25, Mike runs a small but profitable plumbing operation with

00:58
2 vans and 3 employees.

01:00
He's making good money but growth is still capped by

01:02
his ability to handle calls and find new customers.

01:05
After learning about AI automation, he decides to make a

01:07
significant investment despite the high early adopter costs. First, Mike

01:11
implements an AI receptionist system that answers every single call

01:14
24 7. No more missed calls at 3 AM when

01:16
someone's pipe bursts. No more paying for an answering service

01:19
or losing business to competitors who answer first. The AI

01:21
handles scheduling, manages his team's calendar, and even follows up

01:25
with customers automatically. Next, Mike adds in an AI outreach

01:28
system that works in 2 ways. Firstly, cold outreach. The

01:31
AI will call thousands of homeowners in the service area,

01:34
introducing his company and booking appointments for maintenance checks. And

01:37
customer reactivation.

01:38
The AI will regularly call his past customer database with

01:41
seasonal maintenance offers and upgrades. So Mike's plumbing v 2

01:44
here is he has his business here and now he's

01:47
setting up an inbound voice agent which is going to

01:49
be handling and passing bookings in and that's sort of

01:51
the external facing 1. And then he has the outbound

01:53
agent that is sending calls out to his list and

01:56
out to people in his area to generate leads and

01:58
bookings that can go into the business as well. So

02:00
he's attacking it from 2 sides, managing inbound and also

02:03
increasing outbound volume as well.

02:06
So for the first few months, the initial implementation isn't

02:08
all smooth sailing. Mike invests nearly 40000 dollars in getting

02:12
these systems up and running, a big bet for a

02:14
small plumbing company. The first 2 months are challenging. The

02:16
AI sometimes miss books appointments. His team needs time to

02:19
adapt to the new systems. His some customers are initially

02:22
confused by the AI.

02:23
But by month 4, things click into place. The systems

02:26
work like clockwork and the results are transformative.

02:29
His 2 vans are consistently booked out. New customer acquisition

02:32
costs have dropped by 60 percent. Profit grows 200 percent

02:35
in the first 6 months. He adds 1 new van

02:38
by the end of year 1. So we've got here.

02:40
Here's where we started out. This actually isn't quite my

02:42
designer

02:43
slightly missed the point here but you get the idea.

02:45
He gave it a good dig but he started off

02:47
here, invest in the AI systems and over the coming

02:49
years, he's able to increase the number of vans consistently.

02:52
And then we have John.

02:54
We have our our mate John up here, John's premium

02:57
plumbing service. Meanwhile, John runs a larger operation of 5

03:00
vans. So Mike started off with his 2,

03:03
Just 2 vans and 3 employees

03:05
and

03:06
John is his competitor. He's actually out doing them. He's

03:08
in the in the area as well but he's got

03:10
5 vans and he hears about Mike's AI systems but

03:12
decides to wait until the technology is more proven and

03:14
affordable. Okay. A typical

03:17
early majority

03:18
or even late majority who wants to see all the

03:20
proof and make sure it absolutely works first before they

03:23
take a bet on it. So fast forward to 20

03:25
27, John finally implements similar systems. This time, he pays

03:28
15000 dollars not 40 for what are kinda now more

03:31
standard AI tools. There's better sass and agencies that are

03:35
offering at better prices and things like that. But it's

03:37
become more standardized throughout the industry and the implementation of

03:39
course goes smoother with the solutions already been proven and

03:42
the ways to do it kind of being already laid

03:44
out for the agencies that he works with. And the

03:46
systems work pretty well right out of the box because

03:48
of that. But the market has shifted dramatically. Old mate

03:51
Mike

03:52
from up here, by the time John has actually jumped

03:55
on this, Mike already runs the largest plumbing operation in

03:57
the area with his 8 bands.

03:59
The most prime service hearers have already got established relationships

04:02
with Mike's company through all of the cold outreach he's

04:04
doing and then he's reengaging them and he's been really

04:06
really attentive to them, answering all the calls that come

04:08
in. Customers expect the level of service Mike's AI systems

04:12
provide when it comes to say answering the phone on

04:14
time. And John's growth is much slower despite lower implementation

04:17
costs. Basically, he decided to sit in his hands, wait

04:19
for the price to come down, wait for it to

04:21
become a lot more proven. And in that time, while

04:24
Mike did have to take a bit of a gamble

04:26
here and had a bit of a rocky start, he

04:28
was able to leapfrog

04:29
over John

04:31
and end up with a vice grip on the market

04:33
basically through the systems that he set up. And John's

04:35
left it far too late. So the numbers tell the

04:37
story. You can compare the financial impact over the 3

04:39
years. Of course, this is hypothetical, but you've gotta start

04:41
somewhere with these kind of scenarios. Right? So Mike's investment

04:44
in 20 25, he was down 40000 because he had

04:46
to do the initial investment. By the end of year

04:48
20 25, he was up 400000 in additional revenue. By

04:51
the end of 20 26, he's got another 800000 in

04:54
additional revenue. And by the end of 20 27, he's

04:57
up 2360000

04:59
by the end of the year. Then if we look

05:01
at John, he goes down by 15 in 20 27.

05:04
And by the end of the year, he is up

05:06
200000 as well. But this, of course, taking a snapshot

05:08
at the end of 20 27 shows quite clearly that

05:11
just the time and delay of waiting around for these

05:13
things is what really does most of the damage for

05:15
these businesses. The cost of waiting far exceeded the premium

05:18
paid for early adoption. He recouped this investment many many

05:21
times over. This of course does depend

05:23
on a successful implementation that this actually drives results.

05:27
But while Mike paid more and worked through the early

05:29
challenges, he built an unassailable market position that created a

05:32
lasting competitive advantage. And this is what you really need

05:34
to communicate to your clients that these tech revolutions are

05:37
the only chance businesses really have to climb the pecking

05:39
order with relative ease. Right? Things get really baked in

05:43
like when digital marketing came out, that was the last

05:45
kind of big shift. Right? Those who became digital first

05:47
and use social media marketing and Facebook ads to fill

05:50
their pipelines up and and get a really effective digital

05:52
marketing strategy going, they were the ones that dominated the

05:55
industry. Now we're having that again where AI is offering

05:58
a sort of shuffling of the pecking order but businesses

06:00
need to attack it and hit it hard if they

06:02
wanna be able to move up the rank rather than

06:04
being crushed by their competitors. So until AI came along,

06:06
the only edge available to people in in industries like

06:09
plumbing was through very creative digital marketing. And even that

06:13
was in the very late stages and therefore was quite

06:15
hard to achieve. It was extremely competitive. You had to

06:17
have a very good agency or someone very specialized to

06:20
come and to help you to get some kind of

06:21
marketing edge over the people who are already crushing it.

06:23
So if they want to be the big dog in

06:24
town for their industry or for their business or the

06:27
big dog globally for their for their niche, now is

06:30
the time to do it. But they must be willing

06:32
to invest and put in the work so that they

06:34
can get these kinds of early early mover advantages.
