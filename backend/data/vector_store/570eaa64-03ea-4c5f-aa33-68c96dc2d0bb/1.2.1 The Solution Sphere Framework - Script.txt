Alright. So next up, we have the solution sphere framework.

00:03
In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, AAA owners face a

00:06
daunting challenge. Making sense of the various AI solutions available

00:09
and understanding how they can work together effectively. The sheer

00:12
number of options from chat bots to automation tools to

00:15
AI systems can create confusion about what to implement and

00:18
where and how different solutions complement each other and drive

00:21
the most value within businesses. To bring order to this

00:23
complexity and chaos, we need a mental model that helps

00:26
us to understand not just what each AI solution does,

00:29
but where it creates the most value in a business.

00:31
As Charlie Munger wisely noted, you can't really know anything

00:33
if you just remember isolated facts and try to bang

00:35
them back. If the facts don't hang together in a

00:37
lattice work of theory, you don't have them in a

00:39
usable form. You've got to have mental models in your

00:42
head and you've got to array your experience, both vicarious

00:45
and direct, on this lattice work of models. So every

00:47
day, you're gonna encounter new AI solutions, tools, and platforms.

00:50
And without a mental model to organize this information, these

00:53
just become isolated facts. Difficult to remember and harder to

00:56
apply effectively. The SolutionSphere framework provides this essential lattice work

00:59
offering a clear way to map AI solutions to business

01:02
operations while revealing how different solutions can work together synergistically.

01:06
So here we have the solution sphere. We have the

01:07
alpha layer, the middle layer, and the core. And we're

01:10
gonna be breaking this down and how this applies to

01:12
what we've just learned about the different types of AI

01:14
solutions. And this is how I see

01:16
the solutions and how I map them in my brain

01:18
when I am visualizing how AI can help a business.

01:20
So you guys are getting really the exact methodology that

01:22
I use and the team at Morningside uses as well.

01:24
So 3 layers of business operations. At the heart of

01:27
the solutions fear framework is the understanding that every business

01:29
operates across 3 distinct layers. The outer layer is the

01:32
customer interface. This is where a business meets the world.

01:35
It encompasses all customer touch points from initial contact through

01:38
service delivery. And you can think of this as a

01:40
business's service area. Every point where a company interacts with

01:43
prospects, customers, and the broader market. This layer is crucial

01:47
because more connections with prospects means more sales. So systems

01:50
in this layer directly impact revenue generation. So the outer

01:52
layer here is the first touch, the outreach, the qualification,

01:55
the appointment setting, the customer support, this outer interface with

01:59
the world, and your customers.

02:00
The middle layer is employee operations. So inside a business,

02:03
this is where the team performs their daily work to

02:05
deliver your products and services. It's the realm of human

02:08
expertise, judgment, and creativity. Here, employees can analyze

02:12
data, make decisions, create content and more. And this layer

02:15
is where your business's unique value proposition comes to life

02:17
through process, human intelligence, effort and skill. Think of it

02:20
as the voluntary or conscious actions taken in order to

02:23
move towards goals. So this is the layer where you

02:26
do the thing that creates value for your customers. And

02:28
so within this middle layer, we have all of the

02:30
knowledge work around the services you deliver. It's applying a

02:33
certain copywriting framework or hook style that you are really

02:36
good at. This is for if you're doing maybe a

02:38
marketing agency or something or a creative agency. It might

02:41
be your researching process. It might be the delivery process

02:44
for, okay, we use this particular set of softwares and

02:47
we have this template etcetera. So all of this is

02:49
the employee operations that happen in the middle in order

02:52
to deliver your services.

02:53
And then within the core, you have the business systems.

02:55
At a business's foundation lies the core. Basically, the engine

02:58
room of operations for the company. This is where essential

03:01
processes run, data flows between systems, and routine tasks are

03:04
executed. Think of it as the business's nervous system, connecting

03:07
everything together and keeping the wheels turning smoothly. You can

03:09
think of it as the involuntary actions the business, similar

03:12
to a body, takes to stay alive like breathing, digesting,

03:14
etcetera. That's probably the best way that I can describe

03:17
what happens in the core. It's about all of the

03:18
things that need to happen and keep ticking over. Data

03:21
tracking and management, notifications so people know what's going on,

03:24
scheduled reportings, sequence triggers that happen when x happens then

03:27
do y. All of this happens in the core of

03:29
the business. And as businesses scale, these systems need to

03:31
be rock solid so that it can handle the volume

03:34
and support, the middle layer and the customer interface, the

03:37
outer layer, at the same time.

03:39
So now, we get to the interesting part which is

03:40
mapping our AI solution types which we've just covered to

03:42
these business layers and to the solution sphere. What makes

03:45
this sphere so powerful is that it naturally maps these

03:48
3 main types of systems to the business layers we've

03:50
just discussed. So the outer layer, if you hadn't figured

03:52
it out, is mapped to the conversational AI systems we've

03:55
talked about before. Remember, the primary function of these conversational

03:58
AI systems is to be that outer interface and first

04:00
touch with customers. It's where your business meets the world

04:03
which is what the outer layer is essentially. And in

04:05
this outer layer where conversational AI can be the most

04:07
valuable is where businesses face 1 of their biggest scaling

04:10
challenges which is converting the huge volume of customer interactions

04:13
into revenue. Because everyday, businesses receive thousands of potential

04:17
opportunities through website visitors. You've got people calling on phone

04:19
lines. You've got people liking and commenting on social media

04:22
or DMing them on their social profiles. And while each

04:24
Instagram DM or comment might have a lower conversion probability

04:27
than a website form submission, ignoring these touch points and

04:30
all of these Instagram DM's and likes and comments means

04:33
leaving significant revenue untapped. Whereas if you had reached out

04:36
to them or or done something to engage that interest,

04:38
they're still interacting with the business in some way. There's

04:41
just it's economically unfeasible through traditional approaches in order to

04:44
engage with these kinds of opportunities of likes, comments, DMs,

04:48
every person visiting website, anyone calling your phone line. A

04:50
business that receives 5000 monthly visitors and 1000 social interactions

04:54
might only meaningfully engage with 2 to 3 percent of

04:57
all of that interest and traffic that has been sent

04:58
their way. And this is where conversational AI can transform

05:01
this equation by cost effectively handling

05:04
these thousands and thousands of interactions, trying to qualify the

05:06
interest of these visitors and these interactions, and guiding their

05:09
prospects towards some kind of conversion. These systems leverage the

05:12
core benefits discussed in the AI automation economics to dramatically

05:15
expand the business's effective reach. This is going back those

05:17
benefits that we talked about previously. We have unlimited scale.

05:20
Conversational AI systems set up in this outer layer can

05:23
handle thousands of simultaneous conversations without degradation of quality or

05:26
response time. You've got cost effective growth. There's marginal cost

05:29
per conversation approaches 0 unlike a linear scaling with human

05:32
teams. So say you have appointment setters on your Instagram

05:34
DMs, having a conversational AI system set up there, adding

05:37
an extra conversation on basically is not gonna cost you

05:39
anything at all. You can scale up to thousand and

05:41
thousands before you notice any meaningful changes in costs on

05:44
operating those systems which is a huge advantage for businesses.

05:47
They're always available capturing 24 7 interest across all time

05:50
zones, multilingual support, no missed opportunities. And you've got consistent

05:53
quality like I've said before, every interaction follows your best

05:55
practices and messaging perfectly. Again, perfectly as

05:59
in in quotations, it depends on how you've engineered the

06:01
system. If you are good enough, you can create conversational

06:04
systems that can do what they need to do and

06:06
have a very very low error rate equal to or

06:08
or lower than what a human would error at as

06:10
well. It's just like self driving cars. It's difficult to

06:12
get there eventually, but once you have it across that

06:14
line, it will either match or be even safer than

06:17
the human equivalent. And we also have the multi channel

06:19
aspect of it where you can deploy conversational AI systems

06:22
across websites, WhatsApp, voice calls, social media, all at once.

06:25
And so linking back to another concept we discussed as

06:27
well, is this a manual assisted or automated system? Well,

06:29
these are typically fully automated rather than manual or assisted

06:32
because they need to operate autonomously at scale. So in

06:35
this outer layer, we have conversational AI doing personalized outreach,

06:38
appointment setting, answering questions and providing details about the products

06:42
and services. And because there's such a huge amount of

06:44
scale being pushed through these in in most cases, these

06:47
are fully automated in most cases. Aside from the odd

06:50
human hand off feature. But that is not really the,

06:52
the sort of assisted model. It's still automated with a

06:55
sort of blow off and release valve to handle any

06:57
edge cases. An assisted approach would be more like, I

06:59
am a customer support rep a human and I'm using

07:02
AI to help me answer questions live on the phone

07:04
kind of thing. Automated is typically where you gonna end

07:06
up with these systems like fully automated appointment setting systems.

07:09
We use them heavily at Morningside. And when you have

07:11
them working correctly, they are an incredibly

07:13
powerful, edge in the market. And in the middle layer,

07:16
we have AI tools. So the challenge shifts from pure

07:18
scale in this middle layer to enhancing human capabilities in

07:22
that service delivery and value creation processes of a business.

07:25
So AI tools excel here because they can handle the

07:27
routine time consuming aspects of knowledge work like research analysis

07:30
and content creation while preserving human judgment for strategic decisions.

07:34
This creates a multiplier effect. When AI handles the heavy

07:36
lifting, employees can focus on high value activities that truly

07:40
require human creativity and expertise. For example, a sales team

07:43
using AI research tools might analyze a hundred prospects in

07:46
the time it previously took to research 10 while maintaining

07:48
high quality and consistency. This force multiplication

07:51
effect makes AI tools particularly valuable in the middle layer

07:54
where the goal is to enhance rather than replace human

07:56
capabilities. So with AI tools at this middle layer, you

07:59
have enhanced productivity, turning hours of work into minutes while

08:01
maintaining that crucial human oversight in that service delivery process.

08:05
Is it getting better decisions by providing vastly more information

08:08
before making any choices? Instead of having to hire a

08:10
whole research assistant, you can now get AI and use

08:13
deep research features to get all this information into you

08:15
and help you to make that decision when previously you

08:17
would have just had to wing it. Then we have

08:18
scalable expertise. You can give every employee AI powered capabilities

08:22
previously limited to specialists. Like you can use these powerful

08:24
image generation models we have to create custom AI assisted

08:28
design systems for your employees who maybe aren't aren't trained

08:31
in design but they can still get maybe 80 90

08:33
percent of the way there with help from a a

08:35
custom AI system that you build for your clients or

08:37
you use for your own team. Instead of having to

08:39
pay the specialist wage with AI tools, you can empower

08:42
them to have be sort of an AI generalist which

08:44
is what I talk about quite a lot and having

08:46
a a generalist skill set by using AI to get

08:48
those powers. And the flow on effect from what I

08:50
just said is that you can have smaller teams not

08:52
having to have all of these specialists and and people

08:54
that are on payroll doing basic functions like research or

08:58
or design. You can eliminate that low level work,

09:01
meaning you get much leaner teams overall. And so is

09:03
this a manual assisted automated system? You should know that

09:06
by now these are assisted, because they're designed to augment

09:08
rather than replace human judgment. So you start to see

09:10
how all of this fits together. These different types of

09:13
systems and the evolution of work we're going through, the

09:15
different types of solutions that are in the AI solution

09:17
landscape and the layers of a business and how they

09:19
all map together. And then we have the core which

09:22
is mapped to AI workflow automation. So at the core,

09:25
the challenge is maintaining operational efficiency as business complexity grows.

09:29
So workflow automation is nothing new as we've covered. But

09:32
thanks to LLMs and other generative AI tools, the range

09:35
of capabilities for modern AI enhanced workflow automation is far

09:38
greater than ever before. Remember, the main difference is the

09:41
complexity of the tasks that can now be handled with

09:43
workflow automation, thanks to AI integration of various AI models.

09:47
So traditional workflow automation could handle basic functions like splitting

09:50
text, updating databases, searching for keywords, etcetera.

09:53
But now, it is far easier to automate more complex

09:55
tasks that previously required human judgment like categorizing documents, identifying

09:59
entities and images, generating document drafts, or even deciding next

10:03
steps in a process, all while maintaining perfect consistency at

10:06
scale. That is, of course, if you engineer it correctly.

10:08
So the key advantage is compounding efficiency. Each automated process

10:10
reduces operational overhead and eliminates potential errors while creating capacity

10:13
for further automation. So this creates a virtuous cycle where

10:16
the business can continuously optimize the operations while reducing costs.

10:20
So this is a very interesting point to make which

10:23
is with any kind of automation, whether it's through, conversational

10:26
AI. Conversational AI, in many cases, would not be bothered

10:29
with by the company, like, replying to all DMs is

10:31
just something that they wouldn't be doing. So you're essentially

10:34
increasing the capacity for dealing with those leads and and

10:36
adding new, leads to to the business and and increase

10:39
the amount of traffic that they can get an interest

10:41
in their offers. Right? So you're kind of expanding from

10:43
a a low baseline that, hey, look, we're not even

10:45
doing this, but now we can do it. But in

10:47
this case, it's that people are likely already doing. You

10:50
are actually freeing up their time and by automating it,

10:52
they get back maybe 1 or 2, maybe an hour

10:55
a day or or 5 hours a week. And with

10:56
that additional capacity, you can essentially go and and look

10:59
to do further automation with that. So you can work

11:01
with them or train them up in automation so that

11:03
they can then continue to automate more and more of

11:05
the tasks. This is a a really virtuous cycle that

11:07
businesses can get into as they free up time. It

11:10
makes more time for further automation, which is really the

11:12
magic here. So the core benefits of AI workflow automation

11:15
at the core are human level intelligence, generative AI allows

11:18
far more complex workflows to be automated than ever before.

11:20
You have perfect consistency, eliminate human error and variation and

11:23
routine processes, and infinite scalability, which handles increasing volume with

11:27
only slightly increased usage cost. And so is this a

11:29
manual assisted automated system? These systems are, of course, typically

11:33
fully automated because they handle well defined processes that benefit

11:36
from complete automation. Now there is an interesting,

11:38
sweet spot or I wouldn't even say sweet spot, but

11:41
an interesting caveat, which is the combination of automated and

11:44
assisted systems, which is say, like Daniel Dines, the UiPath

11:48
CEO is talking about how you may have a series

11:51
of, an automation that does a certain process. Say it's

11:53
drafting a contract, takes an information, it's it's triggered when

11:56
a call finishes, it takes in the information from the

11:59
transcript, and then it does a number of steps and

12:01
then make automation or whatever platform you're on to get

12:03
to a point where it's generated a draft contract and

12:05
modified a template that you had originally. From

12:07
full

12:09
automation to sort of a a human in the loop

12:10
aspect,

12:11
where you can have a team that say your your

12:14
legal team or your operations guy. When they come in

12:16
in the morning, they go, oh, I've got this queue

12:18
of things to check. And basically, they're holding up their

12:20
automation and the rest of the process where they can

12:22
say click on, 1 of the things in their sidebar.

12:24
Just review over the contract, make sure it looks all

12:26
good, and then they can go, okay. Yep. Sweet. Click

12:28
on that. Yes. And then it shoots it off to

12:29
the next part of the automation. So that's a combination

12:32
of full automation with still using human review and double

12:35
checking within it. So that's a very interesting thing you

12:37
can do on things like make on in a 10.

12:39
Sorry. If you go to in a in

12:42
so say if we're on an automation like this,

12:45
you can actually add in something here, which is a

12:47
human in the loop. So you can say, wait for

12:50
human response by, say, Slack. And you can set up

12:52
a human in the loop step where it's going to

12:54
send a message to Slack and await for approval. And

12:57
someone can maybe read over the information that's in Slack.

12:59
You can be outputting all of these. Hey, this contract

13:01
is ready for review. This contract

13:04
And it may it may include in the Slack message

13:05
a link to view that draft contract. And once it's

13:07
all good to go, they can go back into Slack.

13:09
You can set up an automation that monitors for emojis

13:12
on the Slack messages. And once they put a a

13:14
tick emoji, then bang, it continues it on to the

13:16
next step. And these kind of features like what we

13:17
have in n I 10 of a human in the

13:19
loop can be very powerful for those kind of hybrid

13:21
assisted and automated workflows. So here we have the core,

13:24
where we have the mapping of the AI workflow automation

13:26
type of AI solution to most of the processes here

13:29
because they're low complexity, high volume, but increasingly high complexity

13:32
as we start to get more and more advanced AI

13:34
that we can plug into it. And with the use

13:36
of through hybrid automated and assisted systems like we just

13:39
went over, you can really increase that complexity because you

13:41
can add a human in the loop aspect to it

13:43
as well. Let me get into the power of cross

13:45
layer integration.

13:46
True magic of the solution sphere framework emerges when we

13:48
understand how multiple AI solutions across multiple layers can actually

13:52
work together to create a larger and far more valuable

13:54
system. So it's not just AI tools in isolation now.

13:57
It's not just a conversational AI in isolation or an

13:59
inbound voice agent in isolation

14:01
or an automation that underpins all of that. You can

14:04
connect them together into comprehensive systems that really drive significant

14:08
value for businesses. So we have, for example, an AI

14:10
sales development system. You'll see kind of recurring patterns here,

14:13
fairly obvious use cases that come up. And we're gonna

14:15
be covering those extensively later in this set of videos.

14:17
But we can start off here that combines all 3

14:19
layers to create a comprehensive sales machine. So the outer

14:22
layer would be conversational AI where you have an AI

14:24
agent that conducts initial outreach via phone or DMs, which

14:27
is the outreach part of it. And then it handles

14:29
the qualification conversations at scale, which is qualification. And then

14:32
it's going to book appointments with interested prospects,

14:34
in the setting process. So 1 AI agent doing cold

14:37
outreach via phone, so cold calling or you could do

14:39
it via cold outreach on teams and it's gonna be

14:41
able to answer those questions, sort of go back and

14:43
forth and make sure that they're qualified and then can

14:44
set them into appointments if they are qualified. Then in

14:47
the middle layer, we can have AI tools as the

14:49
next step in this process where sales reps can use

14:52
AI research tools to generate pre call reports for insights.

14:54
So, hey, here's the LinkedIn profile for this person. Here

14:57
is their name and the company name and the company

14:59
URL. Can you please give me some information and do

15:01
a web search, etcetera, to give me some better ingredients

15:04
to go into this call with a better understanding of

15:06
how I can approach it. Then, the final step would

15:08
be an underlying workflow automation process that has automatic post

15:11
call analysis to update the CRM post call with conversation

15:14
outcomes and provides coaching insights and provides data to the

15:17
sales manager. So there's some really cool stuff you can

15:19
do immediately after that call has ended, and you can

15:21
see how all of this can kind of fit together

15:23
into a comprehensive system. So a business using the system

15:26
can engage hundreds of prospects daily while ensuring each conversation

15:29
is informed by deep research and followed up consistently. What

15:32
previously required multiple SDRs or appointment centers can now be

15:35
accomplished with 1 to 2 closes focusing purely on qualified

15:38
opportunities. So the key takeaways for this section is that

15:40
as an AI automation agency owner, understanding how different AI

15:43
solutions map to operations is crucial for your success. The

15:45
solution sphere framework gives you a powerful mental model for

15:48
understanding and classifying the vast majority of solutions you'll encounter

15:51
and helps to remind you where various forms of AI

15:53
should be implemented for maximum effect. That's really the key

15:56
thing here of mapping those different types of solutions to

15:58
where they can be implemented for maximum effect within the

16:01
business. So again, we have the 3 layers. The outer

16:03
layer, where businesses meet their market, all customer touch points,

16:06
sales conversations, and service delivery. This is where scale of

16:08
engagement directly impacts revenue. And within this outer layer, conversational

16:12
AI is the best here. It excels in this outer

16:14
layer by enabling unlimited high quality customer interactions. When you

16:17
help 1 of your clients to engage with every prospect

16:20
24 7, you unlock additional revenue for them. Then we

16:22
have the middle layer where teams create value through expertise

16:25
and effort, research analysis, content creation, and decision making. This

16:28
is where their human capabilities can be amplified. And of

16:30
course, AI tools create maximum value here in this middle

16:33
layer by multiplying these human capabilities. Your best workers, you

16:35
want them to be supercharged. And this is really good.

16:37
We're gonna see the shift in the in the labor

16:39
force where you have companies that downsize drastically but just

16:42
all of that downsize to the most capable and and

16:44
intelligent people at the top,

16:46
because then they can cut away a lot of the

16:48
stuff underneath and just have these super intelligent people who

16:50
are doing all of the best work supported by AI

16:53
agents and AI tools in this middle layer. So, your

16:55
clients, teams can accomplish in minutes what used to take

16:57
hours, dramatically improving productivity without losing that human judgment. And

17:00
finally, the core, the operational foundation, processes, data flows, and

17:03
routine tasks that keep the business running. This is where

17:05
the automation compounds efficiency. And of course, AI workflow automations

17:09
fit in here, thriving at the core layer by handling

17:11
increasingly complex processes at scale. And the level of complexity

17:14
you can handle is determined by, well, 1, the capabilities

17:17
of the technology as it continues to get better and

17:19
better, but also your engineering capabilities as a team. So

17:21
as your clients grow, these systems become more and more

17:24
valuable creating compounding efficiency gains. As the system that you

17:26
create at handling a hundred units or a hundred tasks

17:29
per month can scale up to 10000, it's an incredibly

17:32
big jump up in value that you're providing for your

17:34
client and making that scaling process a lot easier. Which

17:36
brings us to a recap of hybrid versus isolated systems.

17:39
So, when starting out, it's best to focus on just

17:41
getting a small win for your clients. Then once you've

17:43
delivered these kinds of small wins successfully, these isolated systems,

17:46
we might just pick, hey, let's just build 1 AI

17:48
tool for you. Or let's just build 1 workflow automation

17:51
or 1 conversational AI system. Once you've got those down

17:53
and you've got a bit of momentum and experience under

17:55
your belt, you can explore how you can build other

17:57
systems across the layers that knit together into something far

18:00
more valuable. You might start with an AI tool and

18:02
say, hey. Well, we can actually push this up 1

18:04
or down 1 and we can add different things on

18:06
either side of it. Only once you have experience delivering

18:08
more comprehensive systems should you start pitching for them out
